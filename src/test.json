As a US tech nerd, I was jealous. Competition in the\nAndroid space isn't quite as diverse here as it is in the places you can easily\nbuy the Phone 1, and beyond its unique styling, Nothing's inaugural phone was\nwidely praised as a good device at a good price. It felt like we were missing\nout.\n\nSo I'm excited Nothing's second phone, the Nothing Phone 2, is available here in\nthe US, too. It keeps the same general feel as the Phone 1, but in a bigger,\nbrawnier package. After a couple of weeks with the phone, I'm a fan — but iffy\n4G compatibility on Verizon and middling camera quality will complicate the\nPhone 2 for a lot of Android fans, even at its $599 starting price.\n\nnothing-phone-2-square\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-square.jpg]\n\nNOTHING PHONE 2\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 is Nothing's second phone, but the company's first to be\nsold in the United States. At a starting price of $599, it's got a lot to offer,\nincluding a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset, a 120Hz OLED display, 45W fast\ncharging, and a unique design. \n\nSoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1\n\nDisplay 6.7\" 1080p LTPO OLED, 120Hz\n\nRAM 8GB, 12GB\n\nStorage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB\n\nBattery 4,700mAh\n\nOperating System Android 13 with Nothing OS 2\n\nFront camera 30MP f/2.5\n\nRear cameras 50MP f/1.9 primary; 50MP f/2.2 ultrawide\n\nDimensions 162.1 x 76.4 x 8.6mm, 201.2g\n\nColors White, Gray\n\nCharging 45W wired (2.25A only), 15W wireless\n\nIP Rating IP54\n\nPrice $599 (8/128), $699 (12/256), $799 (12/512)\n\nPros\n\n * Great performance\n * All-day-plus battery life\n * Clean software experience\n * Looks neat\n\nCons\n\n * Limited Verizon compatibility\n * Cameras are hit-or-miss\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND NETWORK\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 is available to order now on the company's website. In the\nUS, the base model with eight gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage costs $599.\nYou can upgrade to 12 gigs of RAM and 256 of storage for $699, or 12/512 for\n$799. It comes in either white or gray, though the $599 version with eight gigs\nof RAM only comes in gray.\n\nWhile it's currently just available direct from Nothing, the Phone 2 is\ncertified for use on both AT&T and T-Mobile. It's not certified for Verizon's\nnetwork. You can still use it on Verizon, and sub-6 5G connectivity will work\njust fine. But the Nothing Phone 2 lacks support for LTE band 13, which is\nimportant for Verizon's 4G coverage. If you're on Verizon (or an MVNO that uses\nits network) and depend on 4G connectivity, the Nothing Phone 2 probably won't\nwork for you.\n\n\nDESIGN AND DISPLAY\n\nnothing-phone-2-rear-1\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-rear-1.jpg]\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 carries on the distinct design language of the Phone 1, with\na similar transparent back showing off some gussied-up internals and Nothing’s\ntrademark Glyph interface. The most immediately noticeable differences from one\ngeneration to the next are the Phone 2’s size — it’s got a 6.7” display, a bit\nlarger than the Phone 1’s 6.55” panel — and color options. While the Phone 1\ncame in white or black, the Phone 2 comes in white and the sort of smoky gray\nyou can see in the photos here.\n\nThat gray color helps show off an additional new detail: the components under\nthe transparent back panel have more texture than they did in the Phone 1, which\nmakes the Phone 2 all the more visually appealing, with light playing on the\ntiny bumps and ridges in interesting ways. Unlike the Phone 1, which had flat\nglass on the back, the Phone 2’s back panel curves slightly at the edges to meet\nthe iPhone-style flat aluminum frame (Nothing calls it “pillowed glass”). I\nthink the Phone 1's flat back was a cleaner look, personally.\n\nThe Glyph lights on the back of the phone are a little different this time\naround, with an updated layout and more individually controllable zones than the\nNothing Phone 1 had. They still only light up in one color, though — these\naren’t tiny RGB strips.\n\nAside from those differences, the aesthetic here is very much in line with the\nNothing Phone 1. Nothing tells me this was intentional; the company wants to\nestablish a firm, recognizable visual identity that can extend to future\ngenerations of devices. I can’t complain there. Even if it’s not radically\ndifferent year-over-year, Nothing’s design language is still unique and striking\ncompared to most other phones today.\n\nThe hardware feels quality, too: there's no creaking or flexing, the buttons are\nclicky, and the haptics are nice and firm, if a little loud. The phone is IP54\nrated, so it's splashproof, but you still try not to submerge it in water.\n\nnothing-phone-2-threads-app\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-threads-app.jpg]\n\nThe Phone 2's display is a 6.7\", 120Hz OLED panel. It's a little larger than the\nPhone 1's screen, and the hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera is centered\nthis time, rather than tucked into the top left corner. It's a good screen:\ncolors are vibrant, viewing angles are good, and 1080p is plenty crisp. There's\nalso a plastic screen protector pre-installed. The protector on my review unit\nwas scratched up within hours of unboxing the phone and I ended up removing it a\nfew days later, but it's still a nice little bonus.\n\nThere's an optical fingerprint sensor near the bottom of the screen. The scanner\nis just a touch lower in the display than I'd like, but it's a good one: it's\nfaster and more reliable than the sensors in Google's Pixel 7 phones, though not\nquite as quick as the ultrasonic scanners Samsung uses in its flagships.\n\n\nSOFTWARE AND PERFORMANCE\n\nnothing-phone-2-home-screen-1\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-home-screen-1.jpg]\n\nNothing’s software looks fundamentally the same on the Phone 2 as it did on the\nPhone 1. The company’s applied the same light touch to customizing Android 13\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/android-13/] as it did Android 12: the UI here\nfeels a lot like Google’s flavor of Android. If that's still too exotic for your\ntaste, you have the option to choose stock Android over Nothing OS when you're\nfirst setting the phone up.\n\nI like Nothing OS, though; none of the tweaks Nothing makes get in the way or\nfeel forced. While the Phone 2 mostly uses Google’s system apps — Phone,\nMessages, Calculator, Clock, and more — there are a couple of Nothing-branded\napps and a handful of widgets in the company’s distinct dot-matrix style. And\nmercifully, there’s no bloat: no preinstalled games or social media, and no apps\nthat double up on functionality (looking at you, Samsung).\n\nThere’s no bloat: no preinstalled games or social media, and no apps that double\nup on functionality.\n\nYou have the option to add Nothing’s widgets to your lock screen, though I don’t\nknow that any of them are useful enough to justify giving up notification real\nestate — and I wish it wasn't limited to just Nothing's own. You can also blow\nup individual app and folder icons on your home screen to fill four spots rather\nthan one if you want, and Nothing’s launcher has a feature that optionally\nforces all your app icons to show as monochrome, even those that don’t yet\nsupport dynamic themes. You can also use standard icons, proper Material You\ntheming, or custom icon packs from the Play Store.\n\nNothing promises three years of Android updates — that'll see the Phone 2\nthrough Android 16 — and four years of bi-monthly security patches. Nothing has\nonly existed as a company since 2020, though, and released its first phone just\nlast year, so it's hard to predict what long-term support will look like. That\nsaid, the Phone 1 is yet to fall behind on updates, and I'm hopeful Nothing will\nbe able to deliver.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 is powered by a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset and either eight\nor 12 gigs of RAM. The 8+ Gen 1 was Qualcomm's 2022 flagship CPU, found in\ndevices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review/] and the OnePlus\n10T [https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-10t-review/]. It's not as powerful as\nthis year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, but the Phone 2 is still a remarkably snappy\ndevice. Apps don't feel remotely slow to open, multitasking works great, and\ngaming performance is reliably smooth.\n\nMy review unit is the $699 model that comes with 12 GB of RAM, but I don't think\nmost people would miss those four extra gigs. If you happen to need more than\n128 gigabytes of storage, the added RAM is nice headroom to have, but otherwise,\nyou should be safe with the $599 base model.\n\n\nGLYPH INTERFACE\n\nNothing’s Glyph interface is back in the Phone 2. The basic principle is the\nsame: under the transparent rear glass, you'll find strips of LEDs. When you get\na notification, they light up. You can assign different notifications different\nlight patterns, and create custom ringtone/Glyph combos using Nothing’s Glyph\nComposer feature. The Flip to Glyph feature from the Phone 1 makes a comeback,\ntoo: when you put the Nothing Phone 2 face down, your notifications are\nsilenced, letting the Glyph lights do all the work.\n\nnothing-phone-2-glyph-1\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-glyph-1.jpg]\n\nThere are a few handy new additions, though. You can configure notification\nchannels from any app as Essential Notifications, which make one of the Glyph\nstrips light up and stay lit until you view or dismiss them. That alone makes\nthe Glyph lights much more useful — you can keep your phone face down and still\nknow at a glance whether it needs your attention.\n\nThere’s a new Glyph Timer feature that uses one of the Glyph strips as a sort of\nprogress bar for timers, though, strangely, only ones you set from a certain\nwidget or the phone's settings, not from the Clock app. Nothing’s also built an\nexperimental feature for the Uber app that shows your ride’s progress using the\nGlyph interface. I haven’t had the chance to try that yet; it’s neat in theory,\nbut I imagine I’d still be keeping a close eye on my phone’s screen if I were\nwaiting for a ride.\n\nnothing-phone-2-glyph-2\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-glyph-2.jpg]\n\nIn all, the Glyph lights don't add a ton of utility; a single notification LED\non the back of the phone would more or less accomplish the same thing. But they\nlook cool, and they don't detract from any other aspect of the phone. It might\nbe a gimmick, but at least it's a harmless one.\n\n\nCAMERAS\n\nnothing-phone-2-cameras-1\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-cameras-1.jpg]\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 has two 50-megapixel rear cameras: one primary at f/1.9 and\none ultrawide at f/2.2. Photo performance is mixed.\n\nIn good light, the Phone 2 typically takes good pictures. Colors look natural,\ndetail is sharp, and shadows are refreshingly dark — while many smartphone\ncameras aggressively brighten darker areas in photos, the Phone 2 is content to\nlet them fall to near-black a lot of the time. I appreciate that.\n\nThings get a little trickier in more challenging lighting conditions. While the\nPhone 2 is using tried-and-true camera hardware (its primary shooter uses the\nsame sensor as the OnePlus 11\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-11-review/]), Nothing's photo processing\nneeds work. In high-contrast scenes, it's not unusual to lose detail in both\nhighlights and shadows.\n\nThree sets of standard vs. ultrawide shots.\n\nThe cameras also tend to use excessively long exposures in dark settings. That's\nsort of a good thing: a longer exposure means a brighter photo. But I've seen\nshutter speeds for single exposures as slow as 1/5. At such low speeds, even\nwith optical image stabilization, it's hard to get a clear handheld photo.\n\nShutter lag is an intermittent problem as well. Even in relatively bright light,\nthe Phone 2 will often take a beat to actually snap a photo after you press the\nshutter button. It's not always an issue, but I've missed a few pictures of\nmoving subjects because of an unexpected half-second pause before the phone took\nmy photo.\n\nPortrait mode.\n\nThese cameras aren't bad; I've taken plenty of pictures I really like with the\nNothing Phone 2. But even at their best, they can't quite compete with other\nphones in this price range. Hell, last year's Pixel 6a takes appreciably better\nphotos most of the time — and that phone has been as cheap as $250 on sale.\n\n\nBATTERY AND CHARGING\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 comes with a 4,700mAh battery that, for me, has no trouble\nmaking it through at least a full day of use. I've consistently gotten six-plus\nhours of screen time across 24 or more hours away from a charger — and that\nfigure holds true even with battery-intensive tasks like gaming and Google Maps\nnavigation in the mix. With light use, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see the\nPhone 2 make it a full 48 hours between charges.\n\nnothing-phone-2-battery-stats\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-battery-stats.jpg]\n\nThere's 45-watt fast charging here that Nothing says can get the Phone 2's\nbattery from zero to 100 in under an hour. That speed does require a PPS charger\nthat can deliver power at 2.25 amps, though, and not all can. At 5A, charging is\nlimited to 15 watts. A full charge at 15 watts takes about an hour and 15\nminutes. The Phone 2's also got wireless charging at up to 15 watts, plus\nreverse wireless charging at up to five watts.\n\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nAt a starting price of $599, the Nothing Phone 2 offers a compelling blend of\nstyle and performance. Google's Pixel 7\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-7-review/] also starts at $599. The\nPixel offers much better camera performance and Google's killer software\nfeatures like Assistant-powered call screening. It's also guaranteed security\npatches until October 2027, more than a year longer than Nothing's July 2026\ntarget, and is fully compatible with Verizon, 4G and all. But the Nothing Phone\n2 has longer battery life and a larger, faster display — 120Hz to the Pixel 7's\n90.\n\nThe OnePlus 11 retails for $699, but it's often available for the same $599 the\nNothing Phone 2 costs at launch. The OnePlus 11 is a little quicker, has a\nhigher-resolution 1440p display, and generally better camera performance (plus a\n2x telephoto lens). It's also got crazy-fast wired charging at 80W with the\nincluded charger. The Nothing Phone 2 has wireless charging, though; the OnePlus\n11 doesn't. And OnePlus's OxygenOS is a more heavily customized version of\nAndroid than Nothing OS, if stock-ness matters to you.\n\n\nSHOULD YOU BUY IT?\n\nGiven the Nothing Phone 2's strong performance, competitive price point, and\ngenerally okay cameras, it's easy to see parallels with the phones OnePlus was\nmaking back in its \"flagship killer\" days, then under Nothing founder Carl Pei's\nleadership. I think this phone will appeal to the same type of enthusiast\ncustomers who liked OnePlus's early phones: people who want a viable,\ninteresting alternative to more mainstream options at a fair price. General\navailability in the US is going to expose the Phone 2 to a bigger pool of those\nenthusiasts than the Nothing Phone 1 enjoyed, too, and I'm interested to see how\nit affects the upper-midrange market it's competing in.\n\nBut that market is more crowded than it was years ago, and while the Nothing\nPhone 2 punches above its weight on performance, display quality, and style,\ncamera quality isn't quite up to snuff compared to other phones that cost about\nthe same — or even less. Missing LTE band 13 compatibility and Verizon\ncertification will also naturally put off a lot of Verizon subscribers, and the\nGlyph lights on the back of the phone, neat as they are, really don't add much\nto the experience. There's clear room for improvement in these areas, even\nconsidering the Phone 2's sub-flagship price.\n\nnothing-phone-2-glyph-4\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-glyph-4.jpg]\n\nOverall, though, I really like the Nothing Phone 2. It's fast, it lasts all day,\nand it doesn't look quite like any other phone on the market — at least not here\nin the US. If you're not on Verizon (or you're really confident in Verizon's 5G\ncoverage), and you don't need the most camera you can get for the money, the\nNothing Phone 2 is a really good phone at $599.\n\nnothing-phone-2-square\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-square.jpg]\n\nNOTHING PHONE 2\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 is Nothing's second phone, but the company's first to be\nsold in the United States. At a starting price of $599, it's got a lot to offer,\nincluding a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset, a 120Hz OLED display, 45W fast\ncharging, and a unique design. "

Try World War: Battle Heroes Field Armies Call of\nPrison Duty Simulator - or maybe Counter Bottle Shooter: Pro Aim Master Target\nBottle Shoot 3D Game Strike Pistol.\n\nJohn Linneman hosts this troubling look at the worst the Nintendo eShop has to\noffer in glorious 4K. Watch on YouTube\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVRAItS4a18]\n\nThese guys understand how to maximise results within the eShop's horrific search\nsystem, but it's The Last Hope: Dead Zone Survival that really put West\nConnection on the map for many of us when its \"key art\" went viral on social\nmedia, essentially featuring Ellie from The Last of Us with the serial number\nfiled off. The tactic worked and the digital detritus spread like wildfire\nacross the internet.\n\nThe game begins with the Unity splash screen, followed by a completely static\ntitle screen that resembles the key art from UbiSoft's The Division. You're\npresented with three options - New Game, Loading and Controls. If you choose New\nGame, you're treated to a series of still images, with poorly written slides\nexplaining the situation. The premise involves a time machine, zombies and the\ngovernment. The game then loads into an exceptionally choppy first-person\ncutscene showing your character waking up in a hospital room. Welcome to The\nLast Hope, I guess. You play as time-travelling commando Brian on his quest\nto... I don't know, save humanity? It's not really clear.\n\nYour first objective is to leave the hospital, and it's here that you'll start\nto feel your soul slipping away. The hospital consists of three rooms, all\ndivided by loading screens - your hospital room, a hallway and a staircase. The\nframerate is completely unlocked and wildly unstable from the start, though it\nwill get much worse before we are finished. It does run at native 1080p in\ndocked mode and 720p in portable which is nice on paper but given the\nperformance it probably shouldn't.\n\n[https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-6-35-screenshot.png?width=690&quality=75&format=jpg&auto=webp]\nhttps://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-6-35-screenshot.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\nHere's how The Last Hope stacks up against The Last of Us. This is the\nremastered version released for PS4 and, despite its age, I think it's fair to\nsay that it has a visual advantage over The Last Hope. Who do you think would\nwin in a fight? Brian or Joel?\n\nOnce you reach the bottom of the stairs, however, you're greeted by a much\nlonger loading screen that eventually takes you into the city. The entirety of\nthis game takes place in and around this U-shaped street littered with zombies\nand muscle cars. The world is slathered in low resolution, repeating textures\nwith virtually no lighting. Shadows are exceptionally low-res and barely\ncoherent.\n\nThe Last Hope boasts a fully dynamic frame-rate which can range from 60fps all\nthe way down to an eye-popping 15! In certain instances, the game appeared to\nbreak with visible glitching appearing across the screen. Weird blooming\nartefacts, flickering shadows and broken alpha textures. Even worse, opening any\ndoor in the game has a small percentage chance of crashing the game causing you\nto lose all progress. Oh, and when you reboot the game, there's also a risk of\nhitting the New Game option by accident as the main menu is active beneath the\nUnity splash screen. Whoops.\n\nAll story telling is handled via text boxes which often awkwardly intersect with\nother UI elements. As I noted earlier, there is no voice acting in this game and\nthe writing itself makes Twitter posts read more like Tolstoy. Oh and then\nthere's the soundtrack - apart from a song in the main menu, there's just one\nsong in actual gameplay, if you count what sounds like a recording of somebody\nsnoring as a soundtrack. This is the only ambient sound in the entire game and\nyou will hear it from start to finish.\n\n[https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-6-56-screenshot.png?width=690&quality=75&format=jpg&auto=webp]\nhttps://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-6-56-screenshot.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\nHere's how Eva stacks up against Ellie - as you can see, West Connection opted\nto use a low-quality bootleg of Ellie's model with the same outfit and design.\nThere's no lighting, shading or detail present here and what's up with those\neyes?\n\nSomehow though, it's the design and economy of this game that fascinates me the\nmost. This is basically a 15-minute game if you play it correctly but it's very\neasy to break the game entirely. To understand this, let's look at the game's\neconomy.\n\nFirstly, Brian has a health bar, a stamina bar and access to exactly three\nweapons over the course of the game - a baseball bat, a pistol and an assault\nrifle. OK, you technically have a fourth if you count the Molotov cocktail which\ncan be crafted from a horrible menu system. I found enough supplies to craft two\nof them. I determined that there are 64 bullets available for the handgun across\nthe entire game and 100 bullets for the assault rifle. Killing a zombie requires\neither three bullets from your pistol, four bullets from your rifle or three\nhits with the bat. You can swing your bat 20 times on a single stamina meter and\nthere are three MREs in the game to partially refill your stamina. Stamina also\ndrains permanently if you run.\n\nThis means, if you nail every single shot and every bat swing, while never\nrunning, you can kill 46 zombies with your firearms and 12 zombies with the bat,\nmaking that 58 enemies. Add another eight zombies or so if you count the Molotov\ncocktail. There are roughly three to four times that many zombies total in this\ngame. Why does this matter? Well, in certain circumstances, if you waste even\none bullet, you can wind up in an unwinnable situation.\n\n[https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-7-6-screenshot.png?width=690&quality=75&format=jpg&auto=webp]\nhttps://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-7-6-screenshot.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\nWithout any kind of facial animation, dialogue is hilariously unconvincing.\n[https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-8-1-screenshot.png?width=690&quality=75&format=jpg&auto=webp]\nhttps://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-8-1-screenshot.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\nIt turns out pressing 'E' on the Switch to open a door is an impossible\nchallenge.\n[https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-7-36-screenshot.png?width=690&quality=75&format=jpg&auto=webp]\nhttps://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-7-36-screenshot.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\nVisual glitches are commonplace, such as these problems with the traffic lights.\n\nAfter leaving the pharmacy, the game asks you to lockpick this police car - the\nsecond of three total lock picking mini-games in the game. Problem is, the game\ndoes not pause while picking the lock but no indication is given that you're\nbeing attacked so, when you finish this mini-game, the camera pulls out and you\ninstantly die, no matter what. Even worse, the game usually soft-locks on the\n'You Dead' screen forcing you to quit the game entirely and restart it. Just be\ncareful not to spam through the Unity logo and start a new game by accident! To\nfinish this mini-game, you need to kill each zombie in the area - which means\nyou need enough bullets and bat swings to eliminate them all. If you reached\nthis point without the required ammo, you won't be able to do it.\n\nOh, and that's not even touching on the Ellie, er, Eva problem - halfway through\nthe game, you encounter her in the library and she begins to follow you. If Eva\ncomes within spitting distance of a zombie, she enters a crouch and will remain\nthere until all zombies are dispatched. With the limited number of enemies you\ncan kill, this becomes a real problem as it can leave you without enough ammo to\nfinish the game if she crouches at the wrong spot. You'll wind up snaking along\nthe outside of the city and, once she crouches, hope that you can make it to the\nnext loading screen before she dies.\n\nWhat makes this all the more hilarious is the structure. Objectives are laid out\nin a linear fashion on this U-shaped boulevard. You are always locked into\nspecific sections of this street until you complete each objective, so there's\nno opportunity for exploration. From the moment you leave the hospital, the game\nwill present exactly 15 objectives before you complete it, just variations on\nentering an area, searching for items and leaving.\n\n[https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-14-28-screenshot.png?width=690&quality=75&format=jpg&auto=webp]\nhttps://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-14-28-screenshot.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\n[https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-14-18-screenshot.png?width=690&quality=75&format=jpg&auto=webp]\nhttps://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-14-18-screenshot.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\n[https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-14-13-screenshot.png?width=690&quality=75&format=jpg&auto=webp]\nhttps://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/The-Last-Hope-on-Nintendo-Switch---The-Worst-Game-We've-Ever-Reviewed-14-13-screenshot.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\nThese games, produced by students at a local German university, absolutely wipe\nthe floor with anything West Connection Limited has produced.\n\nSo yeah, what else can I say? The products produced by West Connection Limited\nare the eShop equivalent of browser pop-up packed with malware and it's\ndisappointing that Nintendo even allows such a product onto their shop.\n\nThis also got me thinking about smaller projects in general. I mean, check out\nthe Unity-based projects created by students at a local university above - they\nfeature clever, interesting ideas with functional mechanics and an original\nvisual design. These are games made by students still learning about games and\nthey absolutely wipe the floor with anything West Connection Limited has ever\nproduced.\n\nOf course, we're not the only ones to have put this game through its paces - our\ncolleagues at Eurogamer have already done so\n[https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-the-last-of-us-rip-off-on-nintendo-eshop-so-of-course-i-played-it]\n- and attempts to get comment on the game from both Nintendo and Sony were\nattempted, but so far, neither firm has replied.\n\nTesting The Last Hope has been both cathartic yet also eye opening. I'd mostly\nignored the shovelware-infested digital storefronts and assumed many of them\nwere innocuous, but when you see something like this it really pulls back the\ncurtain on the depravity festering within certain corners of the industry. The\nLast Hope is designed to take your money. There is no game here - this is\neffectively a scam. We all knew this from the trailer, but the fact that the\nactual game is so much less than even that awful trailer is genuinely shocking.\nNext time you find yourself looking at something like a Redfall or Destruction\nAllStars and thinking \"Gee, these are bad games\", I want you to step back, take\na deep breath and remember The Last Hope: Dead Zone Survivor."

We’re disappointed that the FTC is\ncontinuing to pursue what has become a demonstrably weak case, and we will\noppose further efforts to delay the ability to move forward.” \n\nActivision Blizzard CCO Lulu Cheng Meservey tweeted\n[https://twitter.com/lulumeservey/status/1679279055613448195?s=20] in response\nto this appeal filing, “The facts haven’t changed. We’re confident the U.S. will\nremain among the 39 countries where the merger can close. We look forward to\ndemonstrating the strength of our case in court – again.” \n\nJudge Corley wrote in their ruling that, “After considering the parties’\nvoluminous pre-and-post hearing writing submissions, and having held a five-day\nevidentiary hearing, the court DENIES the motion for preliminary injunction.”\nThey write that the FTC did not show “it is likely to succeed on its assertion\nthe combined firm will probably pull Call of Duty from Sony PlayStation\" or\n“that its ownership of Activision content will substantially lessen competition\nin the video game library subscription and cloud gaming markets.” \n\nJudge Corley’s ruling contrasts the finding of the U.K.’s Competition and\nMarkets Authority, which blocked Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision\nBlizzard due to concerns over the cloud gaming market\n[https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/04/26/uk-regulators-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-over-cloud-gaming].\nHowever, shortly after Judge Corley’s ruling, Microsoft announced it was pausing\nappeal efforts against the U.K. regulator to negotiate\n[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/07/11/microsoft-says-it-will-pause-its-appeal-efforts-against-uk-regulator-over]\nsomething satisfying both parties. \n\nInterestingly, Microsoft has until July 18 to close this deal. But with this\nappeal filed, it’s unclear if that deadline will be affected. It’s possible the\ncourts respond to the appeal before the July 18 deadline in the form of an\nemergency stay that extends the temporary restraining order currently in place –\nit expires Friday, July 14 – but that’s not guaranteed, as noted by The Verge\n[https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/12/23791274/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-appeal].\nIf that doesn’t happen, Microsoft can theoretically close before July 18, but\nthere’s still the issue of the CMA in the U.K. \n\nThe Verge reporter Tom Warren tweeted\n[https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1679383431971569665?s=20] that NASDAQ (New\nYork City stock exchange) has announced that Activision Blizzard will be removed\nfrom the market before the market opens on Monday, July 17, seemingly alluding\nto Microsoft closing the deal before then or shortly after.

You won't find any lengthy starting\ntutorials, though help can be found within your Journal if required, and\nChristoulakis calls this more friendly survival than Valheim. Not eating or\ndrinking won't immediately kill you, but you'll miss temporary combat advantages\nlike higher constitution or stamina endurance.\n\nEnshrouded also ditches fixed class selection for a neutral build you can\ndevelop across an open skill net. New powers unlock through skill points earned\nwhen leveling up, and I spotted abilities split between Ranger, Warrior and Mage\nstyles. For example, 'Runner' ups your sprinting speed while decreasing stamina\nconsumption, while 'Quick Charge' halves the charge time for magical\nprojectiles. An expansive set of options is available, but removing it to return\nyour skill points is certainly appreciated if something's not working out.\n\nIf building interests you, everything is destructible for new materials.\nEssential items are craftable anywhere, though better items are available\nthrough crafting tables or NPCs. Don't expect to find substantial underground\ncaves when tunneling, but you can terraform the land and build a base. Whether\nyou prefer block-by-block or through pre-determined templates, I can see this\nappealing to both those who prefer simplicity and in-depth creation. An undo\nbutton eases potential frustrations if you make a misstep, too.\n\nInstead of a randomly generated sandbox, Enshrouded uses a 25km fixed layout\nworld. Much like Link in Breath of the Wild, a gliding ability is unlocked early\non for quicker exploration. There's plenty to see between local chasms,\nabandoned dungeons, and fortresses or caves that become labyrinths. I'm\ninterested in how Enshrouded uses lore items that hide within these areas, which\ngo beyond detailing past events and provide hints about unique treasure\nlocations.\n\nJust be careful when approaching lower regions; many contain that dangerous fog\nknown as the Shroud. Entering it puts you in an \"Enshrouded state, \" which sets\noff a time limit to get away, which you can extend through items or finding\nflames. That said, securing safe passage is easier said than done when dangerous\nmonsters lurk within these depths. Though they can appear elsewhere, it's\npleasing to learn they can't come near your base.\n\nMuch like Link in Breath of the Wild, a gliding ability is unlocked early on for\nquicker exploration.\n\nYou’d best be prepared to fight when entering the fog. Select your armor,\nshields, and ranged and melee weapons using a standard equipment system. Prefer\nsomething more magical? Staffs use mana as magical spell ammo, while wands are\nbetter suited for mid-range attacks. Otherwise, you can use a basic attack,\nshield, parry, or dodge roll. Watching the Flameborn sneak attack after hiding\namong tall plant life holds a particular joy and though combat mechanics feel\nfunctional, they could be more in-depth. My hands-off presentation mostly stuck\nto a sword and shield combo, so while two-handed weapons play differently from\nsingle-handed, we couldn't directly compare them.\n\nEach foggy area also has a Shroud Root causing the problem, guarded by a rather\nimposing foe. Defeating them awards randomized higher-tier loot, all upgradable\nto further unlock new perks like additional blunt damage. However, the fog\nremoval resets, and Christoulakis confirms the world regenerates after a set\namount of time. I'm disappointed as I prefer that permanent progression, but\nthat mitigates the risk of any destructive party members destroying your world\nin multiplayer. It also lets you replay quests with friends and Enshrouded\nsupports co-op with up to 15 people.\n\nI didn’t get to see Flameborn's character creator, sadly, and though you can\nonly judge so much from a hands-off demo, what's here certainly looks\nintriguing. By factoring in the more casual players too, this could strike a\nnice balance for survival gameplay. Enshrouded arrives in Steam Early Access\nlater this year, while the full version arrives on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in\n2024.\n\n\nIN THIS ARTICLE\n\nEnshrouded\n[https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/05/03/enshrouded-1683151796116.jpg?width=114&crop=1%3A1%2Csmart]"

The new app\nversion doesn’t seem to carry any major updates with it, though. “Coolwalk” is\nunchanged, and Google hasn’t really delivered any new features. The last notable\ntweak was support for new EV-focused features, but those don’t seem to be widely\navailable at this point, either.\n\nSomething that is new, though, is a new UI update to the Google Assistant on\nAndroid Auto.\n\nThe timing of this redesign may or may not be related to the v10.0 release, but\nregardless of where it’s coming from, the update sees Assistant adopt the “glow”\nlook that’s currently seen on smartphones. This design was first introduced back\nin the Pixel 4 era, when Google introduced the “new” Assistant that was faster\nand more accurate. While that version of Assistant is still exclusive to Pixels,\nthe overall look has expanded to the rest of the Android world.\n\nNow, it’s showing up on Android Auto, in the latest of a long line of Google\nAssistant redesigns.\n\nThe previous look for Assistant in cars was\n[https://9to5google.com/2020/11/04/android-auto-tweaks-its-google-assistant-ui-yet-again/]\nin a black bar with the Assistant logo off to the left side, and text appearing\nas you spoke. This new look keeps the black bar around, but with the logo gone\nand replaced with the “glow.”\n\nBefore that, Assistant went through a bevy of different looks, including along\nthe top of the screen, and even in the taskbar\n[https://9to5google.com/2019/12/05/android-auto-google-assistant-redesign-test/].\n\nWe’re not sure just how widely this new look is rolling out, but we’re seeing it\nattached to Android Auto v10.0.\n\n[https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/07/android-auto-google-assistant-2023.jpg?quality=82&strip=all]\n\n\nMORE ON ANDROID AUTO:\n\n * Android Auto is adding new features for electric vehicles\n   [https://9to5google.com/2023/07/04/android-auto-ev-support/]\n * You can finally open Google Maps on your phone while Android Auto is running\n   [https://9to5google.com/2023/07/01/google-maps-android-auto-running/]\n * Android Auto gets its first garage door opener app, here’s how it works\n   [https://9to5google.com/2023/06/13/android-auto-garage-door-opener-app-tailwind/]\n\nAdd 9to5Google to your Google News feed. \n[https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMMqA-Qow-c_gAg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en]\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "content": "I believe it was Socrates who said, \"I love it when a plan comes together!\"\nJagged Alliance 3's deep but approachable tactical combat delivers that\nsatisfaction on just about every mission. Managing a team of memorable mercs to\nset up turn-based takedowns feels even better with in-depth squad customization\nand many viable playstyles. Its sense of humor rarely managed to make me\nchuckle, but that hardly mattered when I was orchestrating a beautiful symphony\nof destruction… or watching it all come crashing down because everyone missed an\neasy shot on the same turn. That makes me chuckle.\n\nThe basic plot is easy to understand but not without some moral complexity: The\npresident of the fictional West African nation of Grand Chien has been kidnapped\nby a mysterious bad guy calling himself The Major, and your team of\ninternational mercenaries has been hired to rescue him. Set in early 2001,\nJagged Alliance 3 loves to play up the cliches of pre-9/11 action movies while\npresenting a conflict that feels like it could be ripped from the headlines.\nThose two flavors don't always taste great together, and the middle school\ndudebro humor hardly ever really lands for me. But for the most part it's not\nmean-spirited, so I can usually just ignore it.\n\nAnd that got easy once I became engrossed in the turn-based tactical combat,\nwhich is among the best I've seen in years. Your custom squad of up to six mercs\ncan specialize in everything from heavy weapons to sniper rifles to demolitions,\nand I never felt forced to bring a role I don't enjoy simply to fill a niche.\nBecause I'm kind of boring and predictable, I basically made a team of five\nmarksmen and one medic (who was also a pretty good marksman), and approached\neach mission by trying to stay unseen and snipe all the enemies one by one. I\nwasn't punished for lacking a token shotgun guy or melee expert, outside of a\nfew times when I had to break into a compound with very short firing lines.\nThere's a great balance here between maintaining a consistent difficulty and\nallowing a lot of freedom in your playstyle.\n\nI never felt forced to bring a role I don't enjoy simply to fill a niche.\n\nOne area where Jagged Alliance has always differed from its cousins like XCOM is\nthat most of the available mercs are pre-written characters instead of blank\nslates, and come with a distinct personality and visual style. Some even have\nunique combat traits. While I might not have always found the archetypes they\nwere based on especially entertaining, I did like that they weren't just an\nendless procession of mostly indistinguishable grunts. My Canadian medic,\nMichael \"M.D.\" Dawson's whole schtick is that he's very timid and\nself-conscious. He's not even supposed to be here today! But his character trait\ncauses him to make the whole squad feel inspired when he makes a tough shot and\nis surprised by his own competence. Livewire, my hacker, is written as an almost\nexasperating stereotype of a snarky college student, but her practicality\noccasionally opened up some new options for me in quest dialogue when I had her\non my team.\n\nOne thing that did bug me a bit is the way suppression works. It's hard to have\na dedicated machine gunner because you can't just buy ammo with cash outside of\na few places that have a very limited supply, and automatic weapons chew through\nthat precious supply hungrily. Single-shot and even burst-fire weapons don't\nusually suppress enemies at all, even if you have multiple mercs firing on the\nsame target. This meant that it felt unnecessarily difficult to use conventional\nmove-and-fire tactics with my rifle team, which led to some really awkward\ntactical situations. The only way to effectively cover someone trying to move\nup, a lot of the time, is to outright kill everyone shooting at them. And that's\nnot really how a modern firefight works.\n\nAn area where Jagged Alliance 3 stands out from a lot of tactics games is its\ntruly impressive world map. It has well over 100 accessible tiles, each of which\ncomes with its own custom 3D battle map. You'll find everything from dense urban\nareas to open savannah infested by hostile wildlife, and even the ones with no\nenemies or campaign objectives are worth visiting to collect resources like\nmedicinal herbs and even sometimes come across hidden supply caches. Each map is\nattractive and readable, with great use of color and lighting.\n\nPlaying on the permadeath setting, which I would definitely recommend, can be\nnail-bitingly stressful.\n\nThe way cover is spaced out in some of the sparse ones is a bit annoying given\nhow limited my access to effective suppressing fire could be, forcing me into\nopen ground to get any closer to a fortified target. But the way that builds\ntension can be a good thing, even if it sometimes makes me feel like I'm being\ncareless with my team's lives. And playing on the permadeath setting, which I\nwould definitely recommend, that can be nail-bitingly stressful.\n\n\nLEN'S FAVORITE TURN-BASED TACTICS GAMES\n\nSome of my favorite turn-based tactics games, in no particular order.\n\nThere's plenty to do as you fight across the Grand Chien map as well, from\nsecuring critical diamond mines that let you keep paying your mercs and prevent\nthem from deserting, to training local militias so you don't have to be\neverywhere at once when periodic enemy raids target your settlements, or simply\nenjoying some R&R to keep everyone in good spirits and thus maximum combat\neffectiveness. Almost every town has an interesting side quest or two, rewarding\nyou with increased loyalty and income. My favorite involved getting a street\ngang of homicidal old ladies back together, which at one point required me to\nhire someone with the Psychopath trait in order to relate to their most\nreluctant former member.\n\nIt's also important to have at least one explosives expert and one tech nerd\nalong in case you need to disarm a booby-trapped container or steal some\nclassified data from a Windows ME laptop. That helped the feeling that everyone\non the team had a specific job, even if I built them all pretty similarly\ncombat-wise.\n\nAlmost every town has an interesting side quest or two.\n\nThe entire campaign took me more than 40 hours as I meticulously combed almost\nall of the map and did nearly all of the side quests offered to me, but it never\nreally overstayed its welcome. I will say that on default difficulty the\neconomics side eventually became a bit too easy to manage: I could have\ntechnically hired multiple squads of mercs once I was stacking cash to the\nceiling, but I got attached to my Alpha Team and never felt like I wasn't able\nto accomplish all of the main objectives with them while keeping a decent\ndefensive line using local militia recruits. It made me wish there were more\nways to spend my money, since even buying new gear is usually a one-time\ntransaction that is only available in select places. You can't just order up\ncrates of bullets or six full sets of advanced body armor.\n\n\nJAGGED ALLIANCE 3 -- THQ NORDIC DIGITAL SHOWCASE 2022 SCREENS\n\nThere are plenty of other options for merc progression, though. For instance,\ndismantling items gives you components that can be used to craft useful weapon\nmods. These might give you bonuses to aimed shots or a higher critical chance.\nArmor can be decked out with ceramic plates that negate the first few hits taken\nto a specific body part. That can be clutch, since headshots deal a lot more\ndamage and getting hit in the hand or the leg can impair your aiming and\nmovement, respectively. Leveling up gives you a choice of perks based on your\nstats, though I found that there weren't enough of these that are really useful\nto my playstyle, so I ended up taking the same ones on most of my squad,\nregardless of specialization.\n\nEven when I had a team of hardened doom snipers and was clearing enemy\nencampments with brutal efficiency, the pacing evened out to be satisfying. And\nthere were enough maps that threw some kind of wrench into my plans, like an\nenormous pit mine or a heavily fortified prison, that no two firefights felt\nexactly the same. There's plenty of room for future playthroughs with options\nlike the Iron Man-style \"Dead is Dead\" mode that auto-saves every time someone\ndies, and \"To the Bitter End\" that disallows saving in combat altogether. I\ndidn't end up hiring even a quarter of the available mercs, either, so there are\nplenty more characters to meet. And if they all have the same amount of dialogue\nas the ones I did hire, simply running a different team would feel like a fairly\nfresh experience."

        "content": "Stability AI, the startup behind the image-generating model Stable Diffusion, is\nlaunching a new service that turns sketches into images.\n\nThe sketch-to-image service, Stable Doodle, leverages the latest Stable\nDiffusion model to analyze the outline of a sketch and generate a “visually\npleasing” artistic rendition of it. It’s available starting today through\nClipDrop, a platform Stability acquired in March through its purchase of Init\nML, an AI startup founded by ex-Googlers,\n\n“Stable Doodle is geared toward both professionals and novices, regardless of\ntheir familiarity with AI tools,” Stability AI writes in a blog post shared with\nTechCrunch via email. “With Stable Doodle, anyone with basic drawing skills and\nonline access can generate high-quality original images in seconds.”\n\nThere’s plenty of sketch-to-image AI tools out there, including open source\nprojects and ad-supported apps. But Stable Doodle is unique in that it allows\nfor more “precise” control over the image generation, Stability AI contends.\n\nUnder the hood, powering Stable Doodle is a Stable Diffusion model — Stable\nDiffusion XL — paired with a “conditional control solution” developed by one of\nTencent’s R&D divisions, the Applied Research Center (ARC). Called T2I-Adapter,\nthe control solution both allows Stable Diffusion XL to accept sketches as input\nand guides the model to enable better fine-tuning of the output artwork.\n\nStable Doodle [https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Untitled-4.png]\n\nImage Credits: Stability AI\n\n“T2I-Adapter enable[s] Stable Doodle to understand the outlines of sketches and\ngenerate images based on prompts combined with the outlines defined by the\nmodel,” Stability AI explains in the blog post.\n\nThis writer didn’t have the opportunity to test Stable Doodle prior to its\nrelease. But the cherry-picked images Stability AI sent me looked quite good, at\nleast in comparison to the doodle that inspired them.\n\nIn addition to a sketch, Stable Doodle accepts a prompt to guide the image\ngeneration process, such as “A comfy chair, ‘isometric’ style” or “Cat with a\njeans jacket, ‘digital art’ style.” There’s a limit to the customization, though\n— at launch, Stable Doodle only supports 14 styles of art.\n\nStability AI envisions Stable Doodle serving as a tool for designers,\nillustrators and other professionals to “free up valuable time” and “maximize\nefficiency” in their work. At the same time, the company cautions that the\nquality of output images is dependent on the detail of the initial drawing and\nthe descriptiveness of the prompt, as well as the complexity of the scene being\ndepicted.\n\n“Ideas drawn as sketches can be immediately implemented into works to create\ndesigns for clients, material for presentation decks and websites or even create\nlogos,” the company proposes. “Moving forward, Stable Doodle will enable users\nto import a sketch. Further, we will include use cases for specific verticals,\nincluding real estate applications, for example.”\n\nStable Doodle [https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Untitled-1.png]\n\nImage Credits: Stability AI\n\nWith tools like Stable Doodle, Stability AI is chasing after new sources of\nrevenue following a lull in its commercial endeavors. (Stable Doodle is free,\nbut subject to limits.) In April, Semafor reported\n[https://www.semafor.com/article/04/07/2023/stability-ai-is-on-shaky-ground-as-it-burns-through-cash]\nthat Stability AI was burning through cash, leading to an executive hunt to help\nramp up sales.\n\nLast month, Stability AI raised\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-28/stability-ai-secures-convertible-note-after-fundraising-struggle?sref=25o06hnO&in_source=embedded-checkout-banner#xj4y7vzkg]\n$25 million through a convertible note (i.e. debt that converts to equity),\nbringing its total raised to over $125 million. But it hasn’t closed new funding\nat a higher valuation. The startup was last valued at $1 billion; reportedly,\nStability was seeking to quadruple that within the next few months."

The service\nwill also be localized in 20 languages, and French, German, Japanese, Spanish,\nand Brazilian Portuguese versions are available now. Of course, I had to try it\nout in Serbian, but read on for the results.\n\n“We’ve been amazed at how creators have been using Firefly to create more than a\nbillion gorgeous images and text effects making it one of Adobe’s most\nsuccessful betas ever in just over three months,” said Ely Greenfield, CTO of\nDigital Media at Adobe. “Today’s announcement is about making Firefly accessible\nto more people in their preferred languages, so they can continue to leverage\nour unique model to bring their imagination to life, and create the highest\nquality assets that are safe for commercial use.”\n\n\nHOW TO USE ADOBE’S TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATOR\n\nUsing Adobe Firefly is pretty straightforward. I find all Adobe’s tools very\nintuitive, and Firefly is no exception. Visit the website, and you get to choose\nwhat you want to create: an image, a text effect, generative fill or recolor,\nand more.\n\n[https://www.diyphotography.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/adobe-firefly-global-1.jpg]https://www.diyphotography.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/adobe-firefly-global-1.jpg\n\nOnce you choose the type of AI stuff you want to create, Firefly will give you a\nbox for your prompt. Make it as straightforward and detailed as you can, and\nclick “Generate” or hit Enter on your keyboard. The site will take you to a page\nwhere you can adjust your image further. You can choose an aspect ratio and\napply different styles and techniques, tones, lighting, and composition. You can\nalso change prompts and try again and again if you’re not happy with the\noriginal results.\n\n[https://www.diyphotography.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/adobe-firefly-global-zirafa.jpg]https://www.diyphotography.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/adobe-firefly-global-zirafa.jpg\n\n\nSAMPLE IMAGES AND PROMPTS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES\n\nI played with Adobe Firefly a little to see what I’ll get. Of course, I had to\ntest it out in Spanish and Serbian Cyrillic since the generator can understand\nthem, so I’ll share those results, too. I tried text effects and the\ntext-to-image generator as I’m personally the most interested in those, and\nyou’ll see the prompts right in the box below the four resulting images. Of\ncourse, I’ll give you the English translation in the captions for the Serbian\nand Spanish prompts I used.\n\n[https://www.diyphotography.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/adobe-firefly-global-cuko.jpg]https://www.diyphotography.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/adobe-firefly-global-cuko.jpg\n[https://www.diyphotography.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cuko-srpski.jpg]https://www.diyphotography.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cuko-srpski.jpgLet’s\ntry it more detailed and in Serbian: a Dachshund wearing tiny white Adidas\nsneakers on all four paws\n[https://www.diyphotography.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cuko-engleski.jpg]https://www.diyphotography.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cuko-engleski.jpgHm,\nmaybe English will be better?

This\nwas my first time trying it, and I found my way around in no time.\n\nFast: There’s no lag or bugs, everything is fast and smooth, and you quickly get\nthe results.\n\nIt understands different languages: Firefly really does understand different\nlanguages, even mine, which is not spoken as widely as Spanish or English. I was\npleasantly surprised with the text effect I got when I wrote my prompts in\nSerbian Cyrillic.\n\nThe results*: this is under an asterisk because not all results are good… Not\neven decent. But the generator surprised me by nailing the images with Spanish\nprompts, even though I speak Spanish at a very basic level.\n\n\nTHE BAD (AND THE UGLY)\n\nThe results: the majority of my tests ended in a disaster, no matter how much I\ntried to be specific and detailed with my prompts. Some were unbearably ugly;\nsome were just kinda weird and wonky. It was my first attempt, however, so I\nthink I would need to practice more to get the most out of Adobe Firefly.\n\nPotential creative and copyright issues: this is a huge topic on its own\n[https://www.diyphotography.net/adobe-firefly-adobe-stock-unhappy-photographers/],\nbut it’s worth mentioning. Text-to-image creations are still in the murky area\nof copyright laws, and they are changing the concept of creativity and art from\nits core. Just remember the recent case of a real photo being disqualified from\na contest “for being AI\n[https://www.diyphotography.net/photo-contest-dismisses-iphone-photo-for-being-ai/].”\n\n\nFINAL WORD\n\nAll in all, if text-to-image generators are your thing, Adobe Firefly can both\nimpress you or disappoint you. I don’t think it’s there yet (like Midjourney,\nfor example), but you can go ahead and experiment with it. You’ll find some tips\nand tricks on Discord\n[https://discord.com/channels/1076190214369853510/1088125880506794075], on a\ndedicated channel for Adobe’s AI image generator."

Samsung\n[https://howl.me/cj6yzDcGx7P] has been in the foldables business for four years\nnow, and with a ton\n[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/get-your-first-look-at-the-oneplus-v-fold-thanks-to-render-leaks/] of\nChinese\n[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/xiaomis-first-foldable-smartphone-takes-on-the-samsung-galaxy-fold/]\nOEMs\n[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/huaweis-foldable-is-thinner-lighter-and-has-more-battery-than-samsung/]\nfollowing in Samsung's footsteps, you could be forgiven for thinking that the\nPixel Fold would simply copy what Samsung is doing. But Google is entering the\nfoldable world with a vision of its own, and it's one I really like. This is the\nfoldable I have long wished\n[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-the-future-is-an-ugly-disappointment]\nfor: a device that's a phone when folded up and a tablet when unfolded.\n\nThe usual Android tablet app selection problems—which are getting better—are\nstill present when in tablet mode. When you do find a tablet app, though, this\nfeels like the first foldable that delivers on the promise of letting you do\nmore on the big screen.\n\nThe Pixel Fold hardware also feels shockingly advanced. Google has turned in\nboth the thinnest foldable on the US market and the one with the biggest\nbattery, which is not what you would normally expect from the software company.\n\nThe elephant in the room, of course, is that durability is a concern. In fact, I\nwas the first person to break a Pixel Fold\n[https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/06/rip-to-my-pixel-fold-dead-after-four-days/].\nCompanies like to talk up the \"ultra-thin glass\" used as a middle layer in\nfoldable screens, but since you can break it with almost anything, including a\nscratch, it's not really protective. The only actual protective layer is a thin\nplastic sheet.\n\nAnd at $1,800, the Pixel Fold [https://amzn.to/44Cjorw] was always going to be a\nluxury item instead of a practical workhorse.\n\n\nTHE “TABLET-FIRST” FOLDABLE\n\nWhat shape should a foldable be? That's still an open question.\n\nThe inner screens are all some kind of rectangle, sure, but the industry hasn't\nsettled on a standard set of aspect ratios for them. One school of thought says\na foldable should be \"two normal smartphone screens next to each other,\" which\nprioritizes using split-screen mode. This is where the Galaxy Fold\n[https://howl.me/cj6yzDcGx7P] lands, with its 2176×1812 inner display. That's\nusually reported as a \"6.5\" aspect ratio, but you could also call it 21:17, or\nvery close to two normal 21:9 smartphone screens next to each other.\n\nSamsung-style hardware has a certain practicality to it, as the selection of\nbig-screen Android apps is still small. The display on a Samsung-style foldable,\nbeing taller than it is wide, tends to keep apps in phone mode. When the phone\nis closed, you get a phone app; when the phone is open, you get a double-width\nphone app. Samsung tends to prioritize multitasking with two (or three!) phone\napps in a split-screen view.  App scaling in Android is complicated, and though\nthere are settings you can change, this is how it works for most apps.\n\nMany of Google's interfaces go with this 50/50 split, and the left and right\nsides are often different colors.\n[https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/34-980x668.jpg]https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/34.jpg\n\nEnlarge [https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/34.jpg] / Many\nof Google's interfaces go with this 50/50 split, and the left and right sides\nare often different colors.\n\nRon Amadeo\n\nGoogle is going in a totally different direction. The Pixel Fold opens up to a\nscreen that is 1840×2208—wider than it is tall, making it look, feel, and run\nlike a mini-tablet. When you open the device up, apps kick over into a dual-pane\ninterface much more readily than they do on tall devices.\n\nA look at the spec sheet might make you wonder if the screen is just a sideways\nGalaxy Fold display. That may be true for the hardware, but the software doesn't\nwork like it does on a Galaxy Fold. The Pixel Fold software package feels like a\nnew, foldable-focused release of Android. We've seen bits and pieces of tablet\ndesign on a Samsung foldable, but it still feels geared toward multitasking,\nwhile the Pixel Fold has a \"tablet-first\" design for both the hardware and\nsoftware.\n\nFor starters, Google is releasing 40-plus in-house \"foldable-optimized\" apps\nalong with the Pixel Fold, and many of the heavy hitters, like Google Maps,\nGmail, Gboard, and Calendar, look great on this screen, with dual-pane views and\ncontrols in all the right spots. A bunch of third parties are releasing foldable\napps now, too, including WhatsApp, TikTok, Spotify, Evernote, Dropbox, and\nMicrosoft apps like Office. The core Android OS also feels like it has been\ngiven some foldables polish, with the settings, clock, calculator, contacts, and\nphone apps all getting new interfaces for foldables and a new taskbar showing up\nthroughout the OS.\n\nGoogle often fails at providing a cohesive ecosystem, either because the\nsoftware and hardware aren't on the same schedule or because it gave up on an\nidea\n[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/googles-pixel-tablet-looks-just-like-a-smart-display-so-why-isnt-it-one/]\nhalfway through making it. The Pixel Fold shows surprisingly good coordination\nacross Google's OS and app selection. There are plenty of things Google could\nimprove, but as a first-generation release, the Pixel Fold is impressive.\n\nPage: 1 2\n[https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/2/]\n3\n[https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/3/]\n4\n[https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/4/]\n5\n[https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/5/]\n6\n[https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/6/]\n7\n[https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/7/]\n8\n[https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/8/]\n9\n[https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/9/]\n10\n[https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/10/]\nNext →\n[https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/2/]"

But\nthere are still some issues with them. Unlike flagship Android phones\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/best-android-phones/], book-style foldables are\nbig, bulky, and thick, making them difficult to carry around in your pocket.\nHonor, the company that was forced to split from its parent company\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/16/huawei-is-selling-honor-to-government-backed-consortium/]\nHuawei, has tried fixing this problem with its latest foldable: the Honor Magic\nV2.\n\nHonor claims to use a titanium hinge and proprietary steel on the Magic V2's\nfolding components. This has allowed the company to reduce the phone's waistline\nto 9.9mm when folded and restrict its weight to 231g. This makes it even lighter\nthan the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review/], which weighs\n234 grams. And just for comparison, the Galaxy Z Fold 4\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review/] weighs 263g. The\nhinge is durable as well, with the Honor Magic V2 boasting of a durability\ncertification from SGS. This certifies the hinge to withstand more than 400,000\nfolds for up to 10 years.\n\nHonor Magic V2 colors\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/honor_magic_v2-colors.jpg]\n\nSource: Honor\n\nThanks to a \"three-in-one\" display driver component, Honor claims it was able to\nfree up additional internal space inside the phone, allowing it to fit a\n5,000mAh dual Silicon-carbon battery. While common on premium smartphones,\nhardly any foldables have shipped with such a big cell. And with 66W fast\ncharging support, topping up the phone should not take a long time as well.\n\nThe FHD+ 120Hz LTPO-based inner folding screen of the Honor Magic V2 measures\n7.92 inches with a claimed brightness of 1,600 nits. As for the 120Hz cover\ndisplay with 2376 x 1060 resolution, it measures 6.43 inches and can reach a\nclaimed peak brightness of 2,500 nits. And since the display has a 20:9 aspect\nratio, it does not feel as cramped as the Galaxy Z Fold 4's outer screen.\n\nHonor says the two displays support 3840Hz PWM dimming, so it should reduce eye\nstrain, especially if you are sensitive to the flickering of OLED panels. These\nspecs already make the Honor Magic V2 superior to the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Z\nFold 5 [https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5/], which is\nshaping up to be a minor upgrade over its predecessor.\n\nTicking inside the Honor Magic V2 is Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 8\nGen 2 chip\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-2-announcement/], with\na higher 3.36GHz clock speed. Paired with an Adreno 740 GPU running at 719Mhz,\n16GB RAM, and up to 1TB storage, the foldable packs enough grunt to easily run\nmultiple heavy apps and games at once.\n\nFor the rear camera setup, Honor uses a 50MP f/1.9 primary shooter with OIS, a\n50MP f/2.0 ultra-wide, and a 20MP f/2.4 telephoto with OIS. One 16MP f/2.2\nselfie snapper resides in a punch-hole on the inner screen, while another is on\nthe cover display.\n\nOther specs of the Honor Magic V2 are equally impressive and include Wi-Fi 6E,\nBluetooth 5.3, USB Type- C with DisplayPort support, and dual-SIM connectivity.\nThe foldable runs on Android 13\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/android-13/]-based MagicOS 7.2 but misses out on\nGoogle Play access since it will be sold in China. It will launch in Silk Black,\nSilk Purple, Gold, and Black colors, with preorders already going live for 8,999\nRMB.\n\nThere's no word from Huawei on when the Magic V2 will make its European debut.\nGiven that the company is again expanding its international presence, this\nshould happen sooner than later."

You aren’t alone. Thankfully,\nthere are ways to spice up your core workouts while keeping on top of your\nfitness goals.\n\nFitness coach and Sweat app [https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/sweat-app]\nco-founder Kayla Itsines [https://www.instagram.com/kayla_itsines/] has devised\nan invigorating ab routine that incorporates fresh moves into your workouts,\nchallenging your core muscles in new and engaging ways. By incorporating unique\nvariations and stimulating combinations, this workout not only adds excitement\nbut also ramps up the intensity.\n\nBefore you get stuck into Itsines’ routine, remember that getting visible abs\nforms one part of core training, and there are various other reasons to\nstrengthen these muscles; a strong core improves posture, helps you lift heavier\nweights and supports your torso and spine during movement. If building visible\nabs is your goal, you'll need to focus on your overall body fat percentage —\nhere's how to calculate your body fat percentage, and why it matters\n[https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-calculate-your-body-fat-percentage-and-why-it-matters].\n\n\n6 EXERCISES TO STRENGTHEN AND DEFINE YOUR ABS\n\nThe workout combines six challenging exercises that will leave your core burning\nand abs sore the following day. You will complete 12 repetitions of each\nexercise and 24 (12 on each side) for the final exercise, which is the side\nplank and crunch. If you can, Itsines recommends completing the full circuit\nthree times overall.\n\nThe routine includes ab bikes\n[https://www.tomsguide.com/news/this-exercise-is-better-than-sit-ups-and-crunches-when-it-comes-to-sculpting-your-abs],\nleg raises\n[https://www.tomsguide.com/news/i-did-50-leg-raises-a-day-for-14-days-heres-what-happened-to-my-abs],\nmountain climbers\n[https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-do-mountain-climbers], side-to-side\nhalf burpees, inchworm, and side plank and crunch. All exercises are worth\ncompleting but below we dive into why the final three moves are particularly\neffective when training the abdominal and core muscles.\n\n\nSIDE-TO-SIDE HALF BURPEE\n\nTo perform a side-to-side half burpee, start in a standing position and lower\ninto a squat. Place your hands on the floor, kick your legs back into a plank,\nthen jump both feet towards one side and back to the center. Repeat the jump to\nthe opposite side. This exercise engages the abs, arms, and legs, making it a\ndynamic and effective move for a full-body workout.\n\n\nINCHWORM\n\nTo do an inchworm, begin in a standing position with feet hip-width apart. Bend\nforward at the waist, placing your hands on the floor. Walk your hands forward\nuntil you reach a plank position. Pause briefly, then walk your hands back\ntowards your feet, returning to the starting position. The inchworm exercise\ntargets the core, shoulders, and hamstrings while promoting flexibility and\nstability throughout the body.\n\n\nSIDE PLANK AND CRUNCH\n\nTo perform a side plank and crunch, start in a side plank position with your\nforearm on the ground and your body in a straight line. Engage your core and\nlift your top leg toward your chest while simultaneously crunching your elbow\ntoward your knee. Return to the starting position and repeat on the other side.\nThis exercise targets the obliques and abdominal muscles, helping to improve\ncore strength, stability, and overall abdominal definition.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE BENEFITS? \n\nRegularly performing ab routines can bring numerous benefits to both aesthetics\nand physical fitness. Exercises, like the ones performed in Itsines’ routine,\ncan help sculpt and define the abdominal muscles, creating a more toned\nappearance. Beyond aesthetics, a strong core provides stability and support for\nthe entire body, improving posture, balance, and overall functional fitness. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that a well-rounded workout routine should\nincorporate exercises targeting all muscle groups, including cardiovascular and\nflexibility training. By maintaining a balanced approach, you can optimize your\noverall health, strength, and well-being while reaping the rewards of a strong\nand toned midsection.\n\n\nMORE FROM TOM'S GUIDE\n\n * Forget crunches — these 5 standing ab exercises blast your core\n   [https://www.tomsguide.com/features/forget-crunches-these-5-standing-ab-exercises-blast-your-core]\n * I did a 7-minute pillar bridge plank every day for a week — here are my\n   results\n   [https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-did-a-7-minute-pillar-bridge-plank-every-day-for-a-week-here-are-my-results]\n * Forget sit-ups, this 4-move ab workout targets your deepest core muscles\n   [https://www.tomsguide.com/news/forget-sit-ups-this-4-move-ab-workout-targets-your-deepest-core-muscles]\n   \n\nInstant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful\ntips.\n\nJessica is an experienced fitness writer with a passion for running.

With these releases, the company introduced new features such as\nfull-page screenshots, bilingual Siri and better SMS sorting for dual-SIM users.\n\nThe Cupertino-based company has added support for bilingual queries to Siri\nstarting with select Indic languages.

Players looking for a more complex experience might go for\nthe broader spell list of a Wizard or the versatility of a Cleric, or come up\nwith fun ways to break the game with the Sorcerer's meta-magic.\n\nRole-play-minded players might want to explore a Warlock's pact or a Paladin's\noath, while chaos-seekers will probably gravitate to the Bard, or use a\nBarbarian character's potential for throwing things around.\n\nAnimal-lovers can choose between the Ranger and the Druid--deciding whether they\nwant to have a pet or be the pet with wild shape. Rogues, according to the devs,\nare invaluable for their lock-picking and trap-disarming ability, as well as\nmaking use of the potential of stealth attacks. If you've played D&D, especially\n5e, this should sound familiar.\n\nThe newest class, Monk, is one that'll benefit tactically-minded players, with a\nwell-built Monk even able to solo difficult content, according to Smith.\n\nCheck out the video above for a more in-depth look into each class, including\nsome of the devs' favorite subclasses, and some of the surprising strengths each\nclass has in Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nAfter being in early access for the last few years, Baldur's Gate 3 is coming to\nPC on August 3, and PlayStation 5 on September 6.

Unlike ChatGPT, it has not been\nreleased to the public.\n\nThe US tech giant says Med-PaLM is the first large language model, an AI\ntechnique trained on vast amounts of human-produced text, to pass the US Medical\nLicensing Examination (USMLE).\n\nA passing grade for the exam, which is taken by medical students and\nphysicians-in-training in the United States, is around 60 percent.\n\nIn February, a study said that ChatGPT had achieved passing or near passing\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/chatgpt-can-almost-pass-the-us-medical-licensing-exam]\nresults.\n\nIn a peer-reviewed study [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-023-00873-0]\npublished in the journal Nature on Wednesday, Google researchers said that\nMed-PaLM had achieved 67.6 percent on USMLE-style multiple choice questions.\n\n\"Med-PaLM performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians,\" the study\nsaid.\n\nTo identify and cut down on \"hallucinations\" – the name for when AI models offer\nup false information – Google said it had developed a new evaluation benchmark.\n\nKaran Singhal, a Google researcher and lead author of the new study, told AFP\nthat the team has used the benchmark to test a newer version of their model with\n\"super exciting\" results.\n\nMed-PaLM 2 has reached 86.5 percent on the USMLE exam, topping the previous\nversion by nearly 20 percent, according to a preprint study released in May that\nhas not been peer-reviewed.\n\n\nELEPHANT IN THE ROOM\n\nJames Davenport, a computer scientist at the UK's University of Bath not\ninvolved in the research, said \"there is an elephant in the room\" for these\nAI-powered medical chatbots.\n\nThere is a big difference between answering \"medical questions and actual\nmedicine,\" which includes diagnosing and treating genuine health problems,\" he\nsaid.\n\nAnthony Cohn, an AI expert at the UK's Leeds University, said that\nhallucinations would likely always be a problem for such large language models,\nbecause of their statistical nature.\n\nTherefore these models \"should always be regarded as assistants rather than the\nfinal decision makers,\" Cohn said.\n\nSinghal said that in the future Med-PaLM could be used to support doctors to\noffer up alternatives that may not have been considered otherwise.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Med-PaLM 2 has been in\ntesting at the prestigious US Mayo Clinic research hospital since April.\n\nSinghal said he could not speak about specific partnerships.\n\nBut he emphasised that any testing would not be \"clinical, or patient facing, or\nare able to cause patients harm\".\n\nIt would instead be for \"more administrative tasks that can be relatively easily\nautomated, with low stakes,\" he added.\n\n© Agence France-Presse [https://www.sciencealert.com/terms-and-conditions]"

The ones I selected\nspark, in me at least, a little bit of joy.\n\nNow bear with me, because not every feature named is a laugh-riot. \n\n\nSTANDBY\n\niOS 17 [https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nuvmPCmZvpHS4b3hm6AYw6.jpg]\n\nSome of the iOS 17 StandBy screen options. (Image credit: Future)\n\nWhy Apple didn't introduce this feature ages ago is beyond me, but iOS 17\nfinally has a StandBy mode that transforms your iPhone into a bedroom alarm\nclock, one that you can now read with one groggy eye open before rolling over\nand going back to sleep.\n\nThe feature will work on all iPhones that support iOS 17 (back to iPhone 8\n[https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-8-review]) but StandBy isn't entirely\nuseful without an Always On display, which you can only find in the iPhone 14\nPro [https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-review] and iPhone 14 Pro\nMax [https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro-max-review].\n\nFor my initial tests, though, I loaded up an iPhone 14\n[https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-14-review] with iOS 17 and that\nconnected it to an Apple MagSafe charger. After that, I just turned the phone\nsideways and leaned it against something. The screen almost instantly turned\ninto a wide-screen clock. I swiped through a few selections including one that\nshowed the clock on one side and my schedule on the other. I could reach out and\nswipe through to see, Reminders, the Weather, and other widgets. There are quite\na few display options, including a classic full-screen clock and one that shows\nyour photos behind the time. \n\nWith the iPhone 14 Pro Max I used for my second set of tests, the Always On\nscreen will stay on all night. Other phones will take a tap on the screen. Plus,\nif you invest in Belkin's new Belkin Boost Charge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless charge\nstand with MagSafe ($99.95/£109.95), you won't have to worry about propping up\nthe phone.\n\nI know, this all sounds useful to you, but it somehow makes the iPhone a little\nmore fun for me.\n\n> This iOS17 Standby mode is pretty sweet. Must be on a charger to work.\n> pic.twitter.com/wVTVcUQOoKJuly 12, 2023\n> [https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/1679220865056006153]\n\nSee more\n\n\nSTICKERS\n\niOS 17 Stickers [https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S2pCKjUrFnr48raxhnNxrQ.jpg]\n\niOS 17 Stickers are easy to create from any photo but take on a whole new\ndimension when you create them with Live Photos. (Image credit: Future)\n\niOS 17's Stickers are obviously fun but I'm not sure you realize just how much\nfun they can be when combined with Live Photos...and Messages.\n\nAs you may recall, stickers are things you create on your iPhone and then use\nacross the platform. They typically come from photos using Apple's brilliant\nlift-subject-from-background feature, which was initially introduced in iOS 16\n[https://www.techradar.com/news/ios-16-includes-some-awesome-hidden-innovation].\nTo access that you open Photos, open an image, and then hold your finger down on\nthe main subject of an image. It does not have to be a person.\n\nWhen you do that the subject will lift and you can drag and drop it anywhere. I\nprefer, though, to drop it and wait for the Copy/Add Sticker/Share menu to\nappear. If you select Sticker, iOS 17 lets you add it to the menu of stickers\nthat you can then use in other Apple apps like Messenger. \n\nCreating a sticker instead of using Copy adds a potential bit of fun to your\nstickers especially if you're using a Live Photo. I took a photo of me waving\nand then made a sticker that shows me waving enthusiastically. Now I can message\nthat sticker to my wife any time she wants. On her end, she sees this tiny\nlooping image.\n\nFun, right?\n\n\nREACTIONS\n\niOS 17 FaceTime Reactions\n[https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLbGL59ZWz4Bo7j8sNWQTb.jpg]\n\nI wish I could say that these reactions were easy to trigger. (Image credit:\nFuture)\n\nI'm not a big FaceTime guy, probably because we use Google\n[https://www.techradar.com/tag/google] Meet at work, and most companies I talk\nto use WebEx or Zoom. FaceTime is not a business tool. It is though for friends\nand families and, if I think about it, the person I FaceTime with the most is my\nwife, and I think she'll appreciate the iOS 17 FaceTime enhancements.\n\nReactions are what they sound like: in-call, graphical reactions you can launch\nduring the call using a series of gestures.\n\nYou can send love by making a heart symbol with your hands and the red hearts\nwill literally appear to come from within your cupped hands and float outward\ntoward the screen.\n\nFor multi-colored balloons, I made a peace sign, and, for an oddly Facebook-like\nthumbs-up graphic, I made two thumbs up.\n\nI did struggle a bit to get any of these working and my wife was not as\nimpressed as I'd hoped.\n\nEven so, I put this feature firmly in the fun column.\n\n\nLESS 'HEY' SIRI\n\niOS 17 Siri [https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yeY8BajwhiZkk6EMySagJn.jpg]\n\nAfter you choose the setting, Siri just needs a little training. (Image credit:\nFuture)\n\nAll these \"Heys\" before our voice assistants listen to us have always made them\nseem so formal. I don't do that every time I want to speak to my wife, kids, or\nfriends. Okay, maybe I just say \"hey,\" without their names. Still, \"hey\" plus\nthe name is a lot.\n\nBeing able to use Siri without the preamble is nice. It was easy to set up, I\njust had to enable Listen for \"Siri\" or \"Hey Siri\" in iOS 17 settings and then\ntrain Siri to respond to phrases both with and without \"hey.\"\n\nOnce I did that I found that Siri would immediately respond to the sound of its\nname. It makes Siri even more personal and, yes, fun.\n\nIf you want to join in the fun and are ready to put your best iPhone\n[https://www.techradar.com/news/best-iphone] on the public beta path, you can\ndownload iOS 17 Public Beta here\n[https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X363&xcust=trd_us_1048929839728952800&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbeta.apple.com%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fphones%2Fios%2Fi-tried-ios-17-and-its-most-fun-filled-features].\n\nSign up to receive daily breaking news, reviews, opinion, analysis, deals and\nmore from the world of tech.\n\nA 35-year industry veteran and award-winning journalist\n[https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ox35RKH2kNKBfSBfvHEoK6.jpg], Lance has\ncovered technology since PCs were the size of suitcases and “on line” meant\n“waiting.” He’s a former Lifewire Editor-in-Chief, Mashable Editor-in-Chief,\nand, before that, Editor in Chief of PCMag.com and Senior Vice President of\nContent for Ziff Davis, Inc.

The entrance Valour also marks Aston Martin’s 110th\nanniversary, a testament to its decades-long tradition of superlative hyper\nvehicles.\n\nThe Aston Martin Valour V12 Supercar, as the brand claims, stands apart from its\npeers as the only front-engined V12 sports car currently available with a manual\ntransmission. This rarity makes it a rare find for automotive enthusiasts who\nappreciate the art of manual driving.  Drawing inspiration from the original V8\nVantage and the Vantage-based RHAM/1 ‘Muncher’ Le Mans racer from 1980, the\nValour exudes the power and elegance that are characteristic of Aston Martin’s\nultimate sports cars.\n\nIts custom body structure, featuring front and rear shear panels, a rear\nsuspension tower strut brace, and fuel tank bracing, further refines its dynamic\ncharacter. Crafted entirely from carbon fiber, the Valour’s bodywork seamlessly\nmerges Aston Martin’s contemporary design language with iconic cues from the\n1970s V8 Vantage. The clamshell bonnet with its large ‘horse shoe’ vent and twin\nNACA ducts ensures ample ventilation for the twin-turbocharged V12 engine\nnestled beneath.\n\naston martin valour V12 supercar manual transmission\n[https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-02.jpg]\nimages courtesy of Aston Martin\n\n\nASTON MARTIN VALOUR V12 SUPERCAR’S VISUAL ELEMENTS\n\nThe Aston Martin [https://www.astonmartin.com/en-us/] Valour V12 Supercar\nintegrates modern aerodynamic principles into its design. The front splitter,\nfront fender vents, vortex-generating exoblades on the rear screen panel,\nupswept Kamm tail, and prominent diffuser harmoniously work to achieve\naerodynamic balance. This meticulous attention to airflow management enhances\nboth the supercar’s performance and visual impact.\n\nThe rear end of the Valour V12 supercar leaves a lasting impression with its\ntail-light graphic, reminiscent of the ground-breaking Valkyrie hypercar. A\nfull-width aluminium accent separates the upper and lower sections, adding a\ntouch of sophistication. The centrepiece of the rear design is the lightweight\nstainless steel triple tailpipe exhaust system, emitting an exhilarating\nsoundtrack while reducing weight.\n\naston martin valour V12 supercar manual transmission\n[https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-03.jpg]\nrear view\n\n\nLIMITED PRODUCTION OF ONLY 110 CARS WORLDWIDE\n\nStepping inside the Aston Martin Valour, the driver is greeted by a two-seater\ncockpit designed for simplicity and tactility. Reflecting Aston Martin’s\nheritage, the focal point is the manual transmission gear lever. The choice of\nmaterials for the gear knob includes machined aluminum, titanium, carbon fiber,\nor walnut, each enhancing the tactile experience, while the exposed shift\nmechanism emphasizes the mechanical connection.\n\nThe Aston Martin Valour V12 Supercar represents the epitome of automotive\nexcellence, combining the power of a front-engined V12 with the sheer pleasure\nof a manual transmission. With its limited production of only 110 cars\nworldwide, the Valour’s rarity can guarantee its status as a coveted collector’s\nitem. The hyper vehicle pays tribute to Aston Martin’s heritage while showcasing\nclassic design and performance, making it its new masterpiece on wheels.\n\naston martin valour V12 supercar manual transmission\n[https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-04.jpg]\naerial view\n\naston martin valour V12 supercar manual transmission\n[https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-01-1.jpg]\nAston Martin Valour is dubbed the only V12 supercar with 6-speed manual\ntransmission\n\naston martin valour V12 supercar manual transmission\n[https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-05.jpg]\nthe entrance of the front-engine V12 supercar marks the 110th anniversary of\nAston Martin\n\naston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-ban\n[https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-ban.jpg]\n\nAston Martin Valour V12 Supercar with six-speed manual transmission\n\naston martin valour V12 supercar manual transmission\n[https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-06.jpg]\nthe exclusive sports car is limited to just 110 cars globally\n\naston martin valour V12 supercar manual transmission\n[https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-07.jpg]\nthe choice of materials for the gear knob includes machined aluminum, titanium,\ncarbon fiber, or walnut\n\naston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-ban2\n[https://static.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-ban2.jpg]\n\nAston Martin Valour V12 Supercar with six-speed manual transmission\n\n1/2\n\nthe design draws inspiration from the original V8 Vantage and the 'Muncher' Le\nMans racer from 1980\n[https://www.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-08.jpg]\n\nthe design draws inspiration from the original V8 Vantage and the 'Muncher' Le\nMans racer from 1980\n\ninterior view\n[https://www.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aston-martin-valour-v12-manual-supercar-designboom-09.jpg]\n\ninterior view\n\nproject info:\n\nname: Aston Martin Valour\n\ncar brand: Aston Martin [https://www.astonmartin.com/en-us/]"

The company hasn't really updated\nthe design, though, and the M1 still delivers decent performance. So this model,\nwith 8GB RAM and a 512GB SSD, is a good deal -- especially at this price. Best\nBuy's not the only site offering the discount, though.\n\nRead our Apple MacBook Air M1 (Late 2020) review\n[https://www.cnet.com/reviews/apple-macbook-air-m1-late-2020-review/].\n\nYou can't beat the picture quality of an OLED TV, and while they are certainly\npricey, they may be worth splurging if you get a good deal\n[https://www.cnet.com/deals/best-oled-tv-deals/]. This S90C model\n[https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/samsung-and-lg-2023-oled-tvs-are-now-the-same-price-starting-at-1900/]\nhas 4K upscaling, HDR10 Plus support, Dolby Atmos and object tracking, a gaming\nhub and more. And right now there's a $500 discount.\n\n\nGAMING DEALS\n\n\nOver the years, Logitech has become known for producing high-quality\naccessories, and this wired gaming headset is no different. Immerse yourself in\na whole new world while playing your favorite games. The headset offers a\nstunning 3D, 360-degree sound stage, large comfortable over-the-ear cushions and\nan adjustable headband. It's also lightweight and comes with a carrying case.\n\nThis HP Omen gaming laptop comes equipped with 16GB of RAM, 1TB of SSD storage,\nan AMD Ryzen 6800H processor and Radeon RX 6650M graphics. With this beast of\nmachine, you'll be able to multitask and game with beautiful graphics. If you're\nlooking for a powerful laptop to game on the go, this is a great option.\n\nIf you've been wanting some memory for your PS5, but money has been tight, this\ndeal is for you. Best Buy is offering WD's 1TB solid-state drive for less than\n$100. The SSD is officially licensed for Sony's console and super easy to\ninstall with its all-in-one heatsink design. Now, you'll be able to store and\nplay more games than ever before.\n\nIt's equipped with last-gen chips -- an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS and GeForce RTX 3060\n-- along with 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD, but $1,100 is a good price for an\nentry-level thin-and-light gaming laptop with the top-end CPU for its class. \n\n\nKITCHEN DEALS\n\nIf you've been curious to try out air frying for yourself, this 3-quart Crux\nmodel is a great place to start -- especially while it's on sale for more than\n60% off.

IGN demonstrated how it works during its ID@Xbox Showcase\n[https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-showcase-demo-1850628773] on July 11.\n\nUp to four players will be able to select their characters, stages, and\nmethodically kill supernatural evils the way they would during a solo Vampire\nSurvivors round. But it looks like the main benefit (or detriment, depending on\nhow useless your friends are) of couch co-op is that the XP pool is shared.\nThough the level-up upgrades afforded by the XP pool alternate based on player\norder (you get skipped if you die), working with your friends to collect XP gems\ncould still help you acquire upgrades much more quickly than you would alone.\n\n\nWide group movement is also shared; you can’t sprint away from your teammates if\nthey’ve locked themselves into a dangerous corner, for example. But as long as\none player is alive, downed players can regain health after a time-out in a\ncoffin to re-join the game.\n\n\n“There will also be a new item in co-op mode that we haven’t shown before,”\nPoncle’s update post on Steam\n[https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3650779172120262145] says.\nThe Friendship Amulet “can appear on the level-up screen and will level-up a\nrandom active weapon for each player. Players will have to decide if they\ntactically (or selfishly) pick a level-up for a weapon of their choice or give\nthe whole group a round of random level-up.”\n\n\nBefore co-op is officially released, Poncle will hold a free hands-on preview in\nLondon “in early August.” The developer will release more details as the event\ngets closer, but it did kindly confirm that “if you don’t have friends [to play\nco-op with] then we can provide some.”\n"

That’s where the new Super Pocket is different. It’s a Game Boy-sized\nhandheld that comes with a small selection of iconic retro games built-in, which\ncan be further expanded through additional cartridges.\n\nPanic’s Playdate Handheld is Almost Here\n\n * Off\n * English\n\nAs much as we’re fans of handhelds like the Anbernic RG35XX\n[https://gizmodo.com/anbernix-rg35xx-review-game-boy-handheld-retro-emulator-1850167528],\nor the Miyoo Mini [https://gizmodo.com/miyoo-mini-review-1848380188], which can\nplay thousands of retro games using software emulation, those devices require a\ncertain level of technical competency to fill with ROM files (digital copies of\ngames once distributed on cartridges or discs) which also aren’t easy to acquire\ngiven emulation is still a bit of a legal gray area. My dad may still love Game\nBoy Tetris, but I’m not ready to hand him an RG35XX and then deal with the\ninevitable tech support calls on how to use it.\n\nThree years ago I reviewed an excellent retro gaming alternative called the\nEvercade which was a handheld featuring an old-school cartridge slot. Instead of\nplaying original Nintendo or Sega cartridges like the Analogue Pocket\n[https://gizmodo.com/the-analogue-pocket-was-worth-the-wait-1848125238], the\ncreators of the Evercade released a collection of their own cartridges, each\nfeaturing a handful of retro titles from various publishers or themes. All of\nthe retro games played perfectly on the Evercade right out of the box, without\nthe need for constantly tweaking emulators, and it’s a handheld I still\nrecommend to novice retro gamers, as well as the newer Evercade EXP\n[https://gizmodo.com/evercade-exp-retro-arcade-gaming-handheld-wifi-portrait-1848995598],\nwhenever I’m asked what handheld to get.\n\nBut moving forward, the new Super Pocket from HyperMegaTech!, a spin-off brand\nof Blaze Entertainment who created the Evercade, might be an even better\nalternative. Where as the Evercade models featured a landscape design similar to\nthe Sega Game Gear, or modern handhelds like the Valve Steam Deck\n[https://gizmodo.com/review-valves-steam-deck-is-glorious-but-unfinished-1848590583],\nthe Super Pocket looks more like the original Nintendo Game Boy with D-pad and\naction button controls located beneath a 2.8-inch, 4:3 aspect ratio, LCD screen,\nbut with two sets of shoulder buttons added to the back.\n\nSeveral colorways of the Super Pocket will be available, but it will launch with\ntwo main versions. The green Taito Edition will come with 17 titles from the\npublisher including Space Invaders, Bubble Bobble, Operation Wolf, The\nNewZealand Story, Rastan, Cadash, Chack’n Pop, Don Doko Don, Elevator Action,\nFootball Champ, Growl, Kiri Kaikai, Legend of Kage, Liquid Kids, Space Invaders\n‘91, Volfied, and The Fairyland Story.\n\nThe blue Capcom Edition will instead come with 12 titles from that publisher’s\nback catalog including 1942, 1943, 1944: The Loop Master, Bionic Commando,\nCaptain Commando, Street Fighter II’: Hyper Fighting, Strider, Wolf of the\nBattlefield: MERCS, Mega Man, Final Fight, Ghouls ‘n Ghosts, and Forgotten\nWorlds.\n\nHowever, neither version of the Super Pocket will be limited to just the bundled\ngames because both are compatible with the collection of expansion cartridges\nalready available for the Evercade and Evercade EXP, pushing the potential\nnumber of retro games that can be played on the Super Pocket to over 500\ntitles—and they’re all properly licensed so there’s no legal concerns\nwhatsoever.\n\nAlthough we’ll have to wait until sometime in November to get our hands on\neither version, the Super Pockets will be available for pre-order\n[https://www.hypermegatech.com/] starting on Friday, July 14, for $59, making\nthem one of the most affordable retro gaming handsets available."

However, the game also allows players to tinker with different\nbuilds, some of which are seemingly a little too much for the in-game enemies to\nhandle. For instance, Blizzard had to nerf a Blood Lance Necromancer build in\nDiablo 4 [https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-endgame-blood-lance-necromancer-build/]\nthat quite literally “broke” the game by causing server lags. Now, it looks like\nit might have to nerf the Necromancer class again considering this player\nmanaged to kill the game’s toughest boss easily.\n\nYouTuber Struth Gaming was the one to achieve this incredible feat where they\nmanaged to obliterate Uber Lilith in Diablo 4\n[https://gamerant.com/tag/diablo-4/] with a unique Blood Orb build. To top it\nall off, the video says that it took 79 seconds to kill the Echo of Lilith, but\nin reality, the player only hit Lilith twice and the rest of it was just waiting\naround for her to complete her animation between the two phases of the fight. In\nthe beginning, the player had already spawned three massive Blood Orbs in the\narena before Lilith appeared. When the fight started, they quickly cast Bone\nPrison and made Lilith vulnerable with some Corpse Tendrils, which was followed\nby a baffling burst of damage that wiped Lilith’s health bar completely.\n\nSomething similar happened during the second phase where Lilith’s health bar\nvanished in one hit, and the rest was just surviving the collapsing floor. Fans\nin the comments were left perplexed after witnessing this as they couldn’t\ncomprehend what happened. Thankfully, Struth Gaming has mentioned that they will\nput up another video explaining this extremely powerful Necromancer build in\nDiablo 4\n[https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-best-summoner-necromancer-build-abilities-skills-paragon-gear-equipment-book-of-the-dead-d4-skeletons/].\n\nSeveral community members already believe that Necromancer is the strongest\nclass in the game right now, and this video is proof for the same. Additionally,\nit was two Necromancers who were the first ones to finish a level 100 Nightmare\nDungeon on Hardcore difficulty in Diablo 4\n[https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-players-tier-100-nightmare-dungeon-hardcore/],\nwhich further cements the community’s belief. However, Blizzard has mentioned\nthat it will be rebalancing a lot of things with the upcoming Season 1 which\nmight see the class get massive nerfs.\n\nDiablo 4 is out now for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.\n\nMORE: Diablo 4’s Scariest Boss Led to an Inevitable Controversy\n[https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-butcher-trophy-cleaver-mount-cosmetic-stash-controversy/]"

If you've been\nshopping around for the best Prime Day smart home deals\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/amazon-prime-day-smart-home-deals/], you've\nprobably come across a bunch of smart lighting options.\n\nPhilips and its Hue brand are at the forefront today, with fresh sales on a\nbunch of products to add to or get you started on a smart lighting setup. You\ncan buy some bulbs separately for use with the Hue app or Alexa and Google\nAssistant, but the best setup comes when you add a Hue Bridge hub that can\ncontrol all of your home's lighting at once. Having a Bridge hub present can\nalso unlock scheduling, music and movie sync, and the ability to control your\nlights even when you aren't at home.\n\nHere are the best Philips Hue deals for day two of Amazon's Prime Day.\n\n\nPHILIPS HUE WHITE AND COLOR AMBIANCE LED SMART BULB\n\nThe Philips Hue A19 white and color smart bulbs can fit into pretty much any\nconventional socket, giving you millions of colors (as well as many shades of\nwhite) to play around with.

        "content": "This Tuesday, 2023-07-11, was Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday for July 2023, so here’s\na brief reminder to do two things:\n\n * Patch early, patch often.\n\nMore than 100 vulnerabilities were patched this month, including four zero-day\nsecurity holes for which working exploit code already exists.\n\nEven though everyone was at risk until Tuesday, it’s important not to be one of\nthose people who remains at risk longer than necessary.\n\nWhen defenders close off holes that cybercriminals are already abusing, you\nshould assume one thing: those crooks are going to focus their attention on the\nstragglers against whom those now-patched attacks are still effective, in order\nto extract the last “value” out of their former zero-day holes.\n\n * Head to our sister site Sophos News for official details about the patches.\n\nWe’ve published an unavoidably lengthy list, based on Microsoft’s official data,\nto help you navigate\n[https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/07/11/julys-patch-tuesday-a-rich-harvest/]\nthrough the many CVE numbers and bug explanations relevant to the numerous\nproducts and services affected.\n\nWe think you’ll find the information easier to work with\n[https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/07/11/julys-patch-tuesday-a-rich-harvest/],\nas a starting point, than Redmond’s own tables and charts.\n\nWe’ve also published an in-depth article\n[https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/07/11/microsoft-revokes-malicious-drivers-in-patch-tuesday-culling/]\nabout an ongoing security issue\n[https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/07/11/microsoft-revokes-malicious-drivers-in-patch-tuesday-culling/]\nthat was serious enough to be addressed in a Microsoft Advisory (ADV230001\n[https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/ADV230001]).\n\nWe’ve given you important, interesting and informative detail about the ongoing\nsaga of malicious kernel drivers, many of them signed and approved by Microsoft\nitself, that have finally been blocked by Windows.\n\n\nTWO QUICK TAKEAWAYS\n\nAs we’ve mentioned above, you can read up about this month’s Microsoft security\nfixes\n[https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/07/11/julys-patch-tuesday-a-rich-harvest/]\non Sophos News, but there are two parts of this month’s patch set that we\nthought we’d cover here.\n\nThe first important item is the matter of those four zero-days that we already\nreferred to.\n\nCVE-2023-32049 and CVE-2023-35311 are security bypass exploits, meaning that\ncriminals can abuse these bugs to sidestep security protections that would\notherwise jump in to help you avoid malware infection or a possible attack.\n\nBetween them, these bugs allow criminals to present you with booby-trapped web\nURLs in your browser, or malicious email content in Outlook, that would usually\npop up a warning to remind you of the risks, and to give you a chance to bail\nout and protect yourself…\n\n…without those warnings appearing at all.\n\nAlthough this isn’t as dangerous as a true remote code execution (RCE) hole,\nwhere an outsider could trick you into running a rogue program just by viewing a\nweb page or by starting a particular network service, you can see why security\nbugs of this sort are gold dust to cybercriminals.\n\nBypasses for security warnings that users have come to expect, and perhaps to\nrely upon, provide a simple and effective way of luring even well-informed and\ncareful users into making costly mistakes.\n\nThere are also patches for two zero-day elevation of privilege (EoP) exploits.\n\nEoP exploits mean that crooks who are already in your network, but without the\nability to do much damage or to steal much data, can promote themselves to\nsysadmin level and thus essentially issue themselves “access all areas” security\nbadges.\n\n\nDODGY DRIVER PROBLEMS\n\nThe second important item is the matter of ADV230001, Microsoft’s advisory\nentitled Guidance on Microsoft signed drivers being used maliciously\n[https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/ADV230001].\n\nThis saga started back at the end of 2022, when Sophos researchers came across\nsomething that you don’t see anywhere near as often as you used to, namely rogue\nWindows kernel drivers\n[https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/12/13/signed-driver-malware-moves-up-the-software-trust-chain/]:\n\nThe great thing about kernel drivers is that they provide a way for third-party\nsoftware to get usefully involved at the very lowest levels of the operating\nsystem, such as supporting esoteric computer hardware, providing additional\ncybersecurity protection, monitoring and managing otherwise invisible details\nincluding memory allocation and resource utilisation, and more.\n\nA kernel-level anti-virus program, for example, can jump in before every program\nruns, and not merely report but also actively block rogue software from loading\nat all.\n\nThe not-so-great thing about kernel drivers is that they offer the very same\nsuper-low-level, mega-dangerous and potentially subversive capabilities to\nmalware creators and cybercriminals, too.\n\nIndeed, kernel-level malware tools, often known as a rootkits, can work the same\nsort of low-level magic in reverse, for example by watching out for known-bad\nprograms and preventing them from being blocked in the first place, and even\nmaking them apparently invisible to scanning tools, directory listing software\nand inventory-taking applications.\n\nThe name rootkit comes from early Unix malware, and references the idea of a kit\nof software tools that helps you not only to get administrator-level access in\nthe first place (known as root on Unix and Unix-like systems), but also to go\nunnoticed for as long as possible.\n\n\nDRIVER CLAMPDOWN\n\nAs a result of the proliferation and abuse of rootkits on Windows XP, Microsoft\nstarted clamping down on kernel drivers, starting back in Windows Vista.\n\nIndeed, in current versions of Windows where Secure Boot is enabled, you can\nonly load kernel drivers that have been officially reviewed and digitally signed\nby Microsoft itself. (There are exceptions to this rule, but you can’t easily\ncreate and load a kernel driver today without sending it to Microsoft for\nscrutiny first.)\n\nAlthough you may, albeit reluctantly, accept that code validation services such\nas Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store will inevitably be permeable to\nmalware, given that their goal is to examine and approve huge numbers of\nthird-party apps quickly, automatically and objectively…\n\n…you might reasonably expect that kernel drivers, given their dangerous powers\nand their comparative rarity compared to regular applications, would be as good\nas impossible to sneak past the Windows vetting process.\n\nLast December’s rogue driver discoveries by SophosLabs, however, ultimately\nturned up a significant list\n[https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/07/11/microsoft-revokes-malicious-drivers-in-patch-tuesday-culling/]\nof kernel-level malware, including 100 drivers signed “personally” by Microsoft\nitself.\n\n68 of the Microsoft-approved rogue drivers were anti-anti-virus tools, aimed at\nkilling off security software “from underneath” by abusing the power and\nauthority of the operating system.\n\nThe rest were more general rootkits aimed at spying on and manipulating data\ninside the operating system, where information as intimate as individual network\npackets to and from every running program can be snooped, surveilled and\nsneakily altered.\n\nTo learn more about the fascinating backstory of these wrongly-signed crimeware\ndrivers, please read our article entitled Microsoft revokes malicious drivers in\nPatch Tuesday Culling\n[https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/07/11/microsoft-revokes-malicious-drivers-in-patch-tuesday-culling/]:\n\n\nWHAT TO DO?\n\nWe said it at the top, albeit in slightly different words: Don’t delay; do it\ntoday.\n\nIf you’re responsible for your own computer, just go to Settings > Windows\nUpdate > Check for updates to see if you’re up-to-date or not.\n\nDon’t forget that the updates won’t be completed until you reboot your computer,\nso aim to do that sooner rather than later.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

College students, maybe, but I’d be nervous about\nusing it at this stage if I were as student after Bard fell on its face taking\nits first steps. There are other options like this out there as other companies,\nlike Notion, attempt to find a way to fit AI into their existing products.\n\n“We’ll be talking to people and communities often to learn about what’s working\nwell and where the gaps are, with the intent of making NotebookLM a truly useful\nproduct.” In other words, we think this is cool but have no idea what to do with\nit. There’s promise here, though, so let’s hope this doesn’t end up in the\nGoogle Graveyard like so many of its other “experiments.” Don’t get attached."

It’s really bad.”\n\nA PC gamer plays a retro-style game on an old CRT using a joystick\n[https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/retro-pc-gamer.jpeg?width=880&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp]\nhttps://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/retro-pc-gamer.jpeg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\nImage credit: stock.adobe.com/Victor\n\nA recent study into the availability of classic video games\n[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/retro] appears to confirm what we all\nsuspected: the vast majority of video games more than a decade old are pretty\nmuch impossible to find in their original forms, due to a mixture of technical\nchallenges, licensing and commercial factors.\n\nThe Game Availability Study [https://zenodo.org/record/7996492] published in\npartnership by the Video Game History Foundation and the Software Preservation\nNetwork found that 87% of video games released in the US before 2010 - the\nreport’s benchmark for “classic”, which just caused me to crumble into dust -\nsimply aren’t in print anymore.\n\nThe study comprehensively lays out what it considers “in print” to mean,\nspecifying that remakes and remasters with “substantial” differences - such as\nYakuza Kiwami [https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami], compared\nto the original Yakuza - aren’t the same as playing the original games. The\nstudy also makes clear that games needed to be “as simple as possible for an\naverage user to play” to be classified as available - meaning that raw source\ncode doesn’t count, nor less, uh, legitimate methods, with the researchers\nadmitting that “it’s true that piracy is often the easiest way - or the only\nway! - to play many classic games”.\n\n“We’re lucky that these games aren’t entirely lost to time yet, but we need to\ndo better than that,” they added. “We shouldn’t accept that we have to forfeit\nvideo game history entirely to the realm of legally murky websites and secret\ntorrents known only to the most diehard of fans.”\n\nThe outcome is summarised by the study’s authors: “It’s bad, folks. It’s really\nbad.” Of the more than 4,000 games looked at, 9 in 10 are considered “critically\nendangered”. That’s averaged across everything from 1960 to 2009, with the\nperiod of 2005 to 2009 not even seeing a fifth of games survive to today. That’s\nreally not that long ago!\n\n[https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/yakuza-kiwami_4KLko0D.jpg?width=690&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp]\nhttps://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/yakuza-kiwami_4KLko0D.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp\n\nAs you’d suspect, things get more and more dire the further back you go, with\ngames released before 1985 seeing a notable drop in availability to well below\n10%, and the 1960s and ‘70s barely above zero. The worst platform studied was\nthe Commodore 64, with just 4.5% of games still available (and most of those are\nthrough a single platform, Antstream Arcade - without which the result would’ve\nbeen 0.75%), while even the juggernaut console of the PlayStation 2 only\nstruggled to 12%.\n\nThe researchers compared the lamentable state of game preservation to that of\npre-World War II audio recordings and American silent films, which have\ncomparably low rates of preservation - despite dating from half a century or so\nearlier than video games.\n\n“The era before the 1983–1984 video game industry crash is like the silent film\nera for video games, a period when the rules and vocabulary of games were first\nbeing established,” they explained of the importance of preserving early games.\n“The problem is that video game history is more than just the bestsellers. If we\nwant to understand and appreciate the history of video games, we need more than\na curated list of the games that publishers decide have commercial value.”\n\nWatch on YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF4RJWgZU4Q]\n\nUnfortunately, while the study says that business is booming around certain\nclassic game re-releases - the big names like Mario\n[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/super-mario] and Final Fantasy\n[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/final-fantasy] - the news is only bad\nfor everyone else, with the research suggesting things will only get worse as\ndigital stores and services are shut down, taking more games into the digital\nabyss. The study gave the example of the 3DS and Wii U eShops, which saw the\nloss of around 1,000 games.\n\nThe study ends with a call for the game industry to work with libraries and\narchivists to take on the task of preserving video game history, insisting that\npublishers and developers can’t do the job alone - especially when some game\ncompanies actively work to hamper the efforts of preservationists.\n\n“This is the moment to sound the alarms for both the video game industry and the\npreservation world,” said Video Game History Foundation co-director Kelsey\nLewin. “The study proves that it’s worse than it looks - for every Mario game\nthat’s available, there’s hundreds of less popular games that are critically\nendangered.\n\n“Our goal is that by exposing just how dire the state of game availability is,\nwe can drive changes to our copyright laws that will make video game\npreservation stronger, and able to take on the challenges of the future.”"

        "content": "The long-awaited release of WrestleQuest\n[https://www.wrestlezone.com/tag/wrestlequest] is less than a month away. I\nrecently played a build of the game and have an initial review of what to\nexpect.\n\nWrestleQuest is a wrestling RPG based on the imaginary world of action figures.\nThe game was announced last March by Skybound Games and Mega Cat Studios.\n\nThe game features the licensed likeness of stars like “Macho Man” Randy Savage,\nThe Road Warriors, Diamond Dallas Page, Jeff Jarrett\n[https://www.wrestlezone.com/features/1375202-jeff-jarrett-jay-lethal-briscoe-chicken-farm-return],\nJake “The Snake” Roberts, and more. The story is narrated by Conrad Thompson,\nwho helps the game shift back and forth in a podcast studio between the two main\ncharacters, Muchacho Man and Brink Logan.\n\nWrestleQuest Conrad Thompson\n[https://www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/07/WrestleQuest_Conrad_Thompson_1280x720.png?w=1024]\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nWhile Muchacho Man clearly takes his inspiration from Randy Savage, it’s\nevidently clear that Brink Logan takes after Bret Hart, even though he’s not a\nfeatured character in the game.\n\nYou’ll find yourself running into quite the cast of characters throughout your\ntime in WrestleQuest, from action figures to random dinosaurs and elephants. It\nvery much feels as if the characters in Toy Story\n[https://www.comingsoon.net/tag/toy-story] were involved in professional\nwrestling.\n\nThere are also several characters in this game that are based on the legendary\nwrestlers from yesteryear, including The Brooter, who is clearly based on WWE\nHall of Famer Hulk Hogan.\n\nWrestleQuest The Brooter\n[https://www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/07/WrestleQuest_The_Brooter_1280x720.png?w=1024]\n\n\nFAMILIAR TERRITORY\n\nIf you’ve played a standard RPG, you will feel right at home with WrestleQuest.\nIt will be easy for someone familiar with the genre to pick up and play this\ngame with relative ease. With the in-game battles playing out in the form of a\nback-and-forth wrestling match.\n\nYou’ll be able to utilize your basic attacks alongside gimmicks that allow you\nto perform special and tag team moves. You’ll also get the utilization of a\nmanager later on that will provide boosts to you based on what you do in the\nmatchup.\n\nYou can also assign each character a separate trait referred to as a “hype type”\nto differentiate each character’s play style. The following options are\nselectable:\n\n * Powerhouse\n * Showman\n * Sidekick\n * Technician\n * Underdog\n\nWrestleQuest gameplay\n[https://www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/07/WrestleQuest_Match_1280x720.png?w=1024]\n\n\nFINISH THE STORY\n\nThe story in itself takes some time to really pick up. The early part of the\ngame very much feels like a tutorial. The problem with this is once the story\nreally picks up, you shift characters and are forced to play as the other\ninstead. Every time I found myself getting invested in Muchacho Man’s story, the\ngame shifted to Brink Logan, resulting in me being taken out of the story.\n\nBased on what I’ve played so far, I think it would have been in WrestleQuest’s\nbest interest to have created two separate playthroughs of the game, with one as\nMuchacho Man and one as Brink Logan. By putting their stories together, I think\nit really hinders the immersion the game is trying to suck you into.\n\nI’m guessing as the game continues, Muchacho Man and Brink Logan will eventually\nmeet up and join forces. Maybe that will change my opinion later, but right now,\nI would have preferred their stories to be separate.\n\nOverall, what I’ve played of WrestleQuest [https://www.wrestlequest.com/en] so\nfar has been an enjoyable experience. This game will certainly delight\nold-school wrestling fans who enjoy the RPG genre. I look forward to\nexperiencing the entire game when it releases on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S,\nPlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n[https://www.gamerevolution.com/platform/playstation?post_type=post], Nintendo\nSwitch, and PC via Steam on August 8 [https://www.wrestlequest.com/en].\n\nDisclaimer: This WrestleQuest build is still in development, and not indicative\nof a final review of the game.\n\nWrestleQuest Jake Roberts\n[https://www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/07/WrestleQuest_Jake_Roberts_1280x720.png?w=1024]\n\nREAD MORE: Jeff Jarrett Is A Sound Effects Expert In New ‘WrestleQuest’ Ad\n[https://www.wrestlezone.com/news/1348839-jeff-jarrett-wrestlequest]\n\nAre you looking forward to WrestleQuest next month?

Since its announcement, it was clear that Bethesda’s\nspace-exploration RPG had an incredibly promising concept at its core, but the\nmore we’ve actually seen of it in action, more likely it seems that it’s going\nto be truly phenomenal.\n\nWhile some are upset that Starfield will be capped at 30fps on consoles\n[https://www.gamingbible.com/news/starfield-would-sacrifice-to-run-60fps-todd-howard-223064-20230623],\nit’s hard to stay disappointed for long when you consider that it'll boast over\n1000 planets to explore\n[https://www.gamingbible.com/news/starfield-will-have-dizzying-number-of-planets-to-explore-20220613],\nwhich is mind-boggling. Just imagine how long it’s going to take to play it to\ncompletion. There’s really not long to wait until we can dive into it, either,\nas it’s set to officially launch on 6 September. However, fans also have the\noption to jump in before then.\n\nTake a look at the story trailer for Starfield\n[https://www.gamingbible.com/starfield] below.\n\nIn case you were unaware, Starfield is getting a five-day early access period\n[https://www.gamingbible.com/news/starfield-playable-early-heres-how-to-jump-in-907809-20230619]\nstarting from 1 September. Anyone can dive in then if they’re willing to pay the\nprice - it’s only available to those who buy the expensive Constellation Edition\n[https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/xbox/starfield-collectors-edition-scalped-for-ridiculous-prices-684335-20230712]\nof the game (for roughly £250/$300) or the Premium Edition (for about\n£100/$100). Alternatively, you can buy the Premium Edition Upgrade for\n£34.99/$34.99, which should allow users to play early via Xbox Game Pass\n[https://www.gamingbible.com/xbox-game-pass], too (meaning that you can simply\npay for the upgrade rather than the entire game).\n\nAlthough this is a super exciting thought, on Reddit, some fans are concerned\nthat they might be disappointed if they pay extra money to get the game earlier\nthan everyone else, and then find that it’s not what they hoped it would be.\n\n“Fingers crossed it'll actually run smoothly on day one,” ZuphCud wrote\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/14wav33/comment/jrid2gc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button].\n“Only reason I’m not buying until it comes out. […] Everyone should wait to be\nsure they know what they're buying. Most people wouldn't buy mystery fruit that\nthey don't know the quality of, but then a lot of them will happily pre-order a\ngame that hasn't been benchmarked by a single person publicly,” Webbeth\ncommented\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/14wav33/comment/jrjeu1d/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button].\n\nOf course, if you’re wary about the quality of Starfield or just aren’t sure if\nyou’ll find it fun, waiting until 6 September and playing via Xbox Game Pass is\nthere as a cheaper option."

The Chinese tech company could rejoin the phone market through the 5G\nsegment, but without access to the Play Store and Google services, Huawei’s\nphone might not get much love from customers in the USA.\n\nWhatever the future holds for Huawei, market watchers say that the company could\nmanufacture 5G versions of existing flagship models this year and bring them to\nthe US market in 2024."

Its Warrior upgrade also makes players Berserk whenever the skill\nconnects with an enemy.\n\nGround Stomp and Leap, with their respective Earthquake Aspects, deal enough\ndamage to clear groups of common monsters while simultaneously providing Crowd\nControl effects. Additionally, they provide large bursts of extra Fury every\ntime they're used, and players will be able to easily top off their main\nresource for their next use of Kick.\n\nPower Kick deals high damage to a single target at the cost of 100% of the\nplayer's Fury. This will increase Death Blow's damage via the Aspect of\nEncroaching Wrath while simultaneously softening enemies up for a guaranteed\ncooldown reset.\n\nUse Strategic Rallying Cry only to break stuns and gain Fortify. Ground Stomp,\nLeap, and Lunging Strike can generate enough Fury to keep Encroaching Wrath\nprimed most of the time, so it's best to use Rallying Cry as a panic button in\ncase players get stunned or immobilized.\n\n\nPASSIVE SKILLS\n\nDiablo 4 Barbarian-2\n[https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/diablo-4-barbarian-2-1.jpg]\n\nSkill\n\nPoints\n\nEndless Fury\n\n3\n\nAggressive Resistance\n\n3\n\nBattle Fervor\n\n1\n\nPit Fighter\n\n3\n\nNo Mercy\n\n2\n\nHamstring\n\n1\n\nTempered Fury\n\n3\n\nInvigorating Fury\n\n3\n\nWalking Arsenal\n\n1\n\nTwo-Handed Axe Expertise\n\n-\n\nThis setup features a decent mix of offense, defense, and sustain. Invigorating\nFury makes Kick heal players every time it's used when at full Fury, while\nBattle Fervor lets players deal the most damage possible with their first use of\nDeath Blow by giving them Berserk for one second.\n\nTwo-Handed Axe Expertise\n[https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-class-mechanic-barbarian-arsenal-expertise-weapon-types-guide/]\nis the preferred Technique bonus here to further increase Death Blow's one-shot\npotential. Tag enemies with Lunging Strike to cause bleeding that slows, go\nBerserk and make them Vulnerable with Kick, then smack them down with a final,\nmassive strike.\n\nWalking Arsenal grants the biggest damage bonus to Death Blow out of all the\nBarbarian Key Passives, but its buff duration is limited. Make sure to bind\nLeap, Lunging Strike, and Death Blow to different weapons in order to trigger\nthis passive consistently.\n\n\nGEAR AND ASPECTS\n\nEarthquakes caused by Barbarian skills in Diablo 4\n[https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/diablo-4-barbarian-earthquake.jpg]\n\nOffense\n\nDefense\n\nUtility\n\nEdgemaster\n\nBul-Kathos\n\nWeapon Master\n\nEncroaching Wrath\n\nMight\n\nGiant Strides\n\nInner Calm\n\nDisobedience\n\nPerpetual Stomping\n\nRetribution\n\nSmiting\n\nEarthquake\n\nGround Stomp's Earthquake plays a big part in buffing this build's damage\noutput. The quake deals damage and increases the Barbarian's outgoing damage as\nlong as they're standing in it. Ground Stomp also stuns targets, opening them up\nto bonuses against Crowd-Controlled and Stunned enemies.\n\nRetribution increases all damage dealt versus Stunned targets\n[https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-crowd-control-types-d4-cc-explained/], while\nSmiting increases the duration of Ground Stomp's stun, protecting players from\ndanger while increasing the window of increased damage. These two, when combined\nwith the Aspects of Inner Calm and Encroaching Wrath, multiply Death Blow's\ndamage astronomically, letting it one-shot elites and even Nightmare Dungeon\nbosses if players have good-enough gear.\n\nPerpetual Stomping and Giant Strides greatly reduce the downtime between Leap\nuses. The mobility and damage reduction buff from Aspect of Bul-Kathos is enough\nto keep players alive in most cases—just make sure to always have Leap ready in\ncase things go sour.\n\nPlayers will need all the Critical Strike Chance they can get on their rings and\ngloves to make this build shine. Use anything with bonuses to Critical Strike\nDamage, Damage against Crowd-Controlled/Slowed/Stunned, and Damage against\nVulnerable.\n\nArmor-wise, players should get the usual host of defensive stats (Life, Armor,\ndamage reduction, etc.) and as many bonus points to Death Blow and Weapon\nMastery skills. The Overkill Unique 2H Mace is nice to have but not necessary.\n\n\nPARAGON BOARDS\n\nThe Exploit Paragon Glyph in Diablo 4\n[https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/diablo-4-exploit-paragon-glyph.jpg]\n\nSlot the Exploit Glyph into the starting board's Glyph Socket\n[https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-glyphs-explained-max-level-radius-farm-get-where-use-how-d4/],\nthen take Warbringer. Equip Mortal Draw onto its Glyph Socket for increased\nCritical Strike Chance, and take the Legendary Node plus the ones that grant Max\nFury so Kick can do more damage.\n\nNext, take Blood Rage for increased uptime on Berserking as well as more damage\nagainst bleeding targets. Follow this up with the Carnage board for even more\ndamage while Berserking.\n\nGood Glyphs include Bloodfeeder on Blood Rage and Territorial on Carnage. Spec\nadditional Paragon Points into nodes that increase damage or survivability as\nneeded.\n\nDiablo 4 is available now on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S."

That's not the fastest drive on the block, but it's certainly\nnot the slowest either. It's still faster than the PCIe Gen 3 M.2 SSDs, and it's\nway faster than any SATA-based SSD or traditional hard drive.\n\nUsually DIY PC builders would get a smaller 1TB or 2TB capacity SSD as their\nprimary boot drive and a large capacity traditional hard drive for their\nstorage. If you buy a prebuilt PC, you'd see the same thing; unless you're\npaying for a super high end rig, you'll rarely get more than 2TB of mixed\nstorage. The main reason is that high-capacity SSDs are simply too expensive to\njustify. However, this SSD deal changes that. For under $200, you could\neffectively get away with a 4TB drive and do away with a second drive. Of course\nthere are people who do need far more than 4TB of storage, but nowadays more and\nmore people are storing backups in the cloud. 4TB is also usually more than\nenough storage to hold all of your apps and games although again, there are\ncertainly exceptions. The fact of the matter is, a 4TB SSD gives you way more\noptions than a 1TB or 2TB SSD, because those capacities are so small that you're\npractically guaranteed to require a second drive. In the world of SSDs where\neven the \"slow\" drives are fast, size matters more.\n\nLooking specifically for a PS5 SSD? Check out all of the best PS5 SSD deals of\n2023 [https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-ssd-deals-for-2023].\n\nIf you buy something through this post, IGN may get a share of the sale.

It offers excellent specs, incredible battery life, and super-fast\ncharging, all for an impressive $570 with today's Prime Day discount.\n\nThere is no shortage of phone deals\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/amazon-prime-day/#android-phone-deals] going on\nfor Amazon's Prime Day [https://www.androidpolice.com/amazon-prime-day/]\nshopping event. We are seeing some major discounts on flagship handsets from\nGoogle, Samsung, and other manufacturers. Somewhat lost in the shuffle, though,\nis this deal on the OnePlus 11\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-11-review/]. The phone features a\nbeautiful 6.7-inch OLED display, impressive performance for its price range, and\n2+ days of battery life. It's so good we named it one of the best Android phones\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/best-android-phones/] this year, and right now,\nyou can snag one for just $570.\n\nFor this price, you get a factory unlocked OnePlus 11 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB\nof storage, but if you want even beefier specs, the 16GB/256GB model is also on\nsale for $665. The discounts are good for $130 and $135 off their original\nprices, respectively, and they are the best no-strings-attached deals we've seen\non these two handsets. It's also worth mentioning that you can eke out even more\nsavings over at Best Buy, which has the 11 starting at $550\n[https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=androidpolice&article_name=The+wonderful+OnePlus+11+hits+an+all-time+low+price+with+this+Prime+Day+deal&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidpolice.com%2Foneplus-11-prime-day-deal%2F&u1=UUapUeUpU1011491&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Foneplus-11-5g-128gb-unlocked-titan-black%2F6531251.p%3FskuId%3D6531251],\nbut you must use the Activate Today\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/how-does-activate-today-work-on-best-buy]\nprogram.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD MAKE THE ONEPLUS 11 YOUR NEXT HANDSET\n\nIf you can get past the strange rear camera design and the quirks of its\nOxygenOS 13 software, the OnePlus 11 should absolutely be your next smartphone\npurchase. It's better in a lot of ways than more prominent flagships, and it\ncosts hundreds less. Take the display, for example. The 6.7-inch 1440p screen is\nbigger and has a better resolution than the Samsung S23+, and it has a 120hz\nrefresh rate for smoother scrolling and animations. It wins in performance, too,\nwith the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 putting the Pixel 7 to shame in most categories, and\nwe found it capable of running even the most intense games at their highest\nsettings.\n\nThe camera is also very solid here — something that can't be said for many of\nthe recent OnePlus phones. The main camera utilizes a 3-lens system paired with\nbranded color tuning, and we found it fairly easy to capture some great shots.\nIf you're not impressed yet, maybe this will do it: the OnePlus 11 features a\nmassive 5,000mAh battery that is good for up to 2 days, even with heavy usage.\nThat's super impressive, but it's even more so when you add in the fact that\nOnePlus' 80W rapid charging takes just over 30 minutes to fully charge your\nphone. This is not a device where you'll have to worry about being low on\nbattery.\n\nOf course, no phone is perfect. For example, there are knocks against the rear\ncamera design and the software, and there's no wireless charging though the\nbattery life and rapid charging combo nullify this quite a bit. But again, if\nyou can get past these things, you can get an awful lot of phone for your money\nright now. Just be sure that when you pick up the handset, you also check out\nour roundup of the best OnePlus 11 cases\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/best-oneplus-11-cases/] for added protection."

The Secret Service said FBI lab results from the packaging found\n“insufficient DNA” and could not retrieve any fingerprints.\n\n“Therefore, the Secret Service is not able to compare evidence against the known\npool of individuals,” a statement from the USSS said.\n\nInvestigators were also unable to identify the particular moment or day when the\nbaggie was left inside the West Wing cubby near the lower level entrance where\nit was discovered.\n\n“There was no surveillance video footage found that provided investigative leads\nor any other means for investigators to identify who may have deposited the\nfound substance in this area,” the agency’s statement said. “Without physical\nevidence, the investigation will not be able to single out a person of interest\nfrom the hundreds of individuals who passed through the vestibule where the\ncocaine was discovered. At this time, the Secret Service’s investigation is\nclosed due to a lack of physical evidence.”\n\nA source familiar with the investigation told CNN that the leading theory\nremains that it was left by one of the hundreds of visitors who entered the West\nWing that weekend for tours and were asked to leave their phones inside those\ncubbies.\n\nThe cubbies where the small bag of cocaine was found is a blind spot for\nsurveillance cameras, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\nWhile there’s surveillance around where the bag was found, cameras are not\ntrained directly on the West Wing cubbies near the lower-level entrance where it\nwas discovered, the source said, making it difficult to identify who left the\nbag behind.\n\n“We’ve been briefed by Secret Service on the outcome of their investigation and\nare reviewing the information,” White House principal deputy press secretary\nOlivia Dalton said in a statement.\n\nCNN previously reported\n[https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/05/politics/white-house-cocaine-found/index.html]that\ncocaine was found in a cubby near the ground floor entrance to the West Wing\nwhere staff-led tours of the White House pass through on their way into the\nbuilding.\n\nVisitors entering the West Wing for tours are asked to leave their phones in\nthose cubbies, which can also be used by staff who cannot bring their phones\ninto a SCIF, or sensitive compartmented information facility, where classified\nmaterials are handled. The cubbies are located near the Situation Room, which\nhas not been used for months due to ongoing renovations.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre expressed confidence last week\nthat Secret Service will “get to the bottom” of the incident.\n\nThe discovery of a powdery substance by Secret Service personnel conducting\nroutine rounds of the building had prompted a brief evacuation as part of what\nthe Secret Service described as “precautionary closures.”\n\nThe Secret Service briefed the House Oversight and Accountability Committee on\nthe case Thursday morning. Leaving that briefing, GOP Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN\nthe case was “the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”\n\nHe said that the bag contained less than a gram of cocaine.\n\n“Y’all have all been to the White House. You give your Social Security number,\nyou get, I mean, I’m sure they have facial identification and everything else,\nand to say that they don’t know who it is, to me, somebody should lose their job\nover this, a lot of people,” he said.\n\nHe added, “Somebody walks in the White House, the most secure building in the\nUnited States of America – in the world, actually – and can place something in a\nlocker. What if it was a biological entity? What if it was something that had an\nemergent that would, you know, would mature over a few days and it could – you\nknow, it’s just a lot of questions.”\n\nGOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene told reporters that the Secret Service informed\nmembers in their briefing that it had narrowed its list of suspects down to 500\npeople. Greene, who said part of the briefing was classified, said she asked\nSecret Service if they would drug test those individuals and she said their\nanswer was no.\n\nThe list includes a mixture of staffers and others on a tour, according to GOP\nRep. Lauren Boebert, but the Secret Service would not provide specifics.\n\nBoebert said the cocaine was found in locker number 50 and the key to that\nlocker is missing. A number of members raised issues with the locker system and\nhow it needs to be more secure.\n\nRepublican Rep. Nancy Mace said the Secret Service had to get visitor logs and\nother information from the Biden administration through the Presidential Records\nAct because the locker where the cocaine was found is under the jurisdiction of\nthe Biden administration.\n\nA Secret Service spokesman said Thursday that “small amounts of marijuana” were\ntwice found at the White House last year. No arrests were made in those cases\neither.\n\n“No one was arrested in these incidents because the weight of the marijuana\nconfiscated did not meet the legal threshold for federal charges or DC\nmisdemeanor criminal charges as the District of Columbia had decriminalized\npossession,” Secret Service spokesman Steven Kopek said in a statement. “The\nmarijuana was collected by officers and destroyed.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, Manu Raju and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report."

The company also\nfalsely claimed to have raised $50 million from its initial token sale, and\nclaimed to have 1 million active users when in fact it only ever had around\n500,000 depositors, many of whom were no longer active, the SEC said.\n\nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission\nalso sued Celsius and Mashinsky. The FTC said it had reached a settlement with\nCelsius that will permanently ban it from handling customers' assets.\n\nThe Justice Department entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Celsius, in\nwhich the company accepted responsibility for its role in the alleged schemes\nand pledged to continue cooperating with investigators, Williams said,\n\nThursday's lawsuits add to a series of challenges for Celsius Network and its\nfounder.

        "content": "LOS ANGELES, July 13 (Reuters) - Hollywood actors will go on strike at midnight\non Thursday after talks with studios broke down, joining film and television\nwriters who have been on picket lines since May and deepening the disruption of\nscores of shows and movies\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hollywood-actors-strike-how-would-it-hit-tv-shows-movies-2023-07-13/].\n\nStudios now face their first dual work stoppage in 63 years, forcing them to\nhalt many productions across the United States and abroad. The twin strikes will\nadd to the economic damage from the writers walkout, delivering another blow to\nan industry struggling with changes to its business.\n\nBoth SAG-AFTRA - Hollywood's largest union, representing 160,000 film and\ntelevision actors - and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) are demanding\nincreases in base pay and residuals in the streaming TV era plus assurances that\ntheir work will not be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe actors' union announced at a Thursday press conference that the strike will\nbegin at midnight after its national board unanimously authorized the walkout.\n\nFran Drescher, former star of \"The Nanny\" TV show and the president of\nSAG-AFTRA, called the studios' responses to actors' concerns \"insulting and\ndisrespectful.\"\n\n\"I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are\ntreating us,\" Drescher said. \"I cannot believe it, quite frankly, how far apart\nwe are on so many things, how they plead poverty that they're losing money left\nand right when giving hundreds of millions to their CEOs. It is disgusting.\"\n\nThe Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the trade\nassociation that negotiates on behalf of Netflix Inc (NFLX.O)\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NFLX.O], Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/DIS.N] and other companies, said it\nwas \"deeply disappointed that SAG-AFTRA has decided to walk away from\nnegotiations.\"\n\nThe group said it had offered the highest percentage increases in minimum pay\nlevels in 35 years, \"substantial increases\" in pension and healthcare\ncontribution caps, and a 76% increase in foreign residuals paid from big-budget\nstreaming shows, among other benefits.\n\nThe studios also put forward \"a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors'\ndigital likenesses,\" the AMPTP said. Actors are worried that their digital\nimages will be used without their permission or proper compensation.\n\n\"Rather than continuing to negotiate, SAG-AFTRA has put us on a course that will\ndeepen the financial hardship for thousands who depend on the industry for their\nlivelihoods,\" the AMPTP said.\n\n\nECONOMIC DAMAGE\n\nThe strike by roughly 11,500 writers has sent late-night television talk shows\ninto endless reruns, disrupted most production for the fall TV season and halted\nwork on big-budget movies.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\n[1/9]SAG-AFTRA union President Fran Drescher and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland,\nSAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator, stand at SAG-AFTRA\noffices after negotiations ended with the Alliance of Motion Picture and\nTelevision Producers (AMPTP), the entity that represents major studios and...\nRead more\n\nThe walkout by SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors from bit-part players to\nHollywood's biggest movie stars, will effectively shutter the studios' remaining\nU.S.-based productions of film and scripted television.\n\nIt will also hamper many overseas shoots involving SAG-AFTRA talent, such as\nParamount Pictures' sequel to \"Gladiator,\" which director Ridley Scott has been\nshooting in Morocco and Malta.\n\nSome production work not involving SAG-AFTRA performers can proceed, such as\nlocation scouting or some post-production editing. But the loss of actors, who\nwill also not promote their films or TV shows while on strike, will put more\npressure on media companies to find a resolution.\n\nHollywood has not faced simultaneous strikes since 1960, when members of the WGA\nand the Screen Actors Guild both walked off the job in a fight over residuals\nfrom films sold to TV networks.\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger, speaking from a gathering of media and tech moguls at a\nresort in Idaho, told CNBC on Thursday that the writers' and actors' unions had\nunrealistic expectations.\n\n\"It's very disturbing to me,\" Iger said, noting the entertainment industry's\nongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. \"This is the worst time in the\nworld to add to that disruption.\"\n\nActors say the rise of the streaming era has made it harder to earn their\nlivelihoods, especially for the many thousands of SAG-AFTRA members who are not\nhousehold names.\n\n\"You have to make $26,000 a year to qualify for your health insurance and there\nare a lot of people who get across that threshold through their residual\npayments,\" actor Matt Damon said at a promotional event held for the film\n\"Oppenheimer\" on Wednesday. \"There's money being made and it needs to be\nallocated in a way that takes care of people who are on the margins.\"\n\nMany streaming services, however, have yet to turn a profit after companies\nspent billions of dollars on programming to try and attract customers.\n\nDisney, Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O)\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/CMCSA.O] NBCUniversal and Paramount\nGlobal (PARA.O) [https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/PARA.O] each lost\nhundreds of millions of dollars from streaming in the most recent quarter.

Tommy Tuberville is being\n“irresponsible” and jeopardizing national security by blocking military\npromotions over his objections to the Defense Department’s\n[https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/politics/tuberville-reaction-military-holds/index.html]\nreproductive health policies.\n\n“I’d be willing to talk to him if I thought there was any possibility he would\nchange his ridiculous position on this. He’s jeopardizing US security with what\nhe’s doing,” Biden said during a news conference in Helsinki, Finland, when\nasked by CNN about Tuberville’s position.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s office attempted to set up a call between the\nsecretary and Tuberville on Thursday, but the Alabama senator’s office declined\nthe opportunity, saying he did not have time for a call on Thursday or this\nweekend, a senior defense official told CNN. Tuberville had complained that\nAustin has not tried to reach him about his hold on military nominations in\nprotest of the Pentagon’s reproductive health policies.\n\nA defense official told CNN Austin and Tuberville eventually spoke at about 1:30\np.m. Thursday. Tuberville’s office said that the call with Austin was\n“productive” and “cordial” and Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder\nsaid, “During the brief call, Secretary Austin explained to Senator Tuberville\nthe impact the holds are having to military readiness and uncertainty in the\nforce.”\n\nTuberville has blocked hundreds of military promotions as a way to protest new\nPentagon policies on reproductive health care, which among other things included\na travel allowance for service members who must go out of state to receive an\nabortion. As of July 7, Tuberville’s hold was impacting 265 senior military\nofficers – including high-profile roles like the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff and the commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\nAn internal assessment put together by the Pentagon and obtained by CNN says the\nholds affect the families of 84 officers awaiting confirmation, including\nofficers who have paid out of pocket to move their families, military spouses\nwho have left their jobs anticipating new assignments, and children unable to\nenroll in new schools.\n\nThe hold disrupts what is typically a routine process of confirming hundreds of\nmilitary nominations at once known as unanimous consent. With Tuberville’s hold\nin place, the Senate would need to take each nomination to the floor for an\nindividual vote, which could take months and hundreds of hours of floor time to\ncomplete. \n\n“I don’t ever recall that happening, ever. It’s just totally irresponsible in my\nview,” Biden said.\n\nTuberville insisted earlier this week in an interview with CNN that he is not\nblocking confirmations and that the Senate had plenty of time to take up the\nnominees. Tuberville has not backed down from maintaining his block on\nnominations as he protests the Defense Department’s reproductive health\npolicies, claiming there is no impact on national security and no risk to US\nmilitary readiness.\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Manu Raju after Biden’s comments, Tuberville said, “It doesn’t\nsound like anybody that wants to sit down and visit and work the problem out. It\nsounds like somebody who wants to argue, and I’m not in this to argue.”\n\nTuberville added: “There’s no chance of changing my position if we don’t sit\ndown and visit. I mean, that’s what you do up here, supposedly, I’m sure he did\nthat over his career of being a senator but he doesn’t want to do it, we won’t\ndo it. We’ll just keep going.”\n\nBiden said he expected the Republican party to “stand up” to Tuberville’s hold\nand “do something about it.”\n\n“I’m confident that the mainstream Republican Party … does not support what he’s\ndoing but they’ve got to stand up and be counted. That’s how it ends,” he said.\n\nTuberville said bluntly that wouldn’t happen.\n\n“Well, that’s not gonna happen,” Tuberville told Raju. “You know, that. I’ve\nalready told that’s not gonna happen. I’m doing it for, not for the Republican\nParty. I’m doing it for Republicans and Democrats and citizens of this country.\nI’m not doing it for just Republicans. I’m doing it for the Constitution.”\n\nCNN reported in June\n[https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/15/politics/tommy-tuberville-pentagon-nominations/index.html]\nthat some of Tuberville’s colleagues have tried to talk with him behind the\nscenes about alternatives. Multiple GOP senators including Armed Services\nCommittee top Republican Roger Wicker, Texas Sen. John Cornyn and Sen. Joni\nErnst of Iowa have talked with Tuberville, careful not to deploy a pressure\ncampaign, but instead understand what he’s aiming to accomplish.\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer earlier on Thursday,\n[https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/politics/lloyd-austin-tommy-tuberville/index.html]\nAustin echoed Biden’s thoughts.\n\n“This is a national security issue. It’s a readiness issue. And, we shouldn’t\nkid ourselves. I think any member of the Senate Armed Services Committee knows\nthat,” Austin said in an interview Thursday with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer following\nthe NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania.\n\n“One in five of my troops … is a woman and our women provide tremendous value to\nthis force and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them,”\nAustin added.\n\nWhen asked if the Pentagon will continue to pay for women to go to other states,\nif necessary, to get an abortion, Austin said, “That’s our policy,” he said.\n\n“I don’t have an abortion policy, I have an access to non-covered reproductive\nhealth care policy,” he added.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN’s Lauren Fox, Nicky Robertson, Clare Foran, Haley Britzky and Oren\nLiebermann contributed to this report."

As a US tech nerd, I was jealous. Competition in the\nAndroid space isn't quite as diverse here as it is in the places you can easily\nbuy the Phone 1, and beyond its unique styling, Nothing's inaugural phone was\nwidely praised as a good device at a good price. It felt like we were missing\nout.\n\nSo I'm excited Nothing's second phone, the Nothing Phone 2, is available here in\nthe US, too. It keeps the same general feel as the Phone 1, but in a bigger,\nbrawnier package. After a couple of weeks with the phone, I'm a fan — but iffy\n4G compatibility on Verizon and middling camera quality will complicate the\nPhone 2 for a lot of Android fans, even at its $599 starting price.\n\nnothing-phone-2-square\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-square.jpg]\n\nNOTHING PHONE 2\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 is Nothing's second phone, but the company's first to be\nsold in the United States. At a starting price of $599, it's got a lot to offer,\nincluding a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset, a 120Hz OLED display, 45W fast\ncharging, and a unique design. \n\nSoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1\n\nDisplay 6.7\" 1080p LTPO OLED, 120Hz\n\nRAM 8GB, 12GB\n\nStorage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB\n\nBattery 4,700mAh\n\nOperating System Android 13 with Nothing OS 2\n\nFront camera 30MP f/2.5\n\nRear cameras 50MP f/1.9 primary; 50MP f/2.2 ultrawide\n\nDimensions 162.1 x 76.4 x 8.6mm, 201.2g\n\nColors White, Gray\n\nCharging 45W wired (2.25A only), 15W wireless\n\nIP Rating IP54\n\nPrice $599 (8/128), $699 (12/256), $799 (12/512)\n\nPros\n\n * Great performance\n * All-day-plus battery life\n * Clean software experience\n * Looks neat\n\nCons\n\n * Limited Verizon compatibility\n * Cameras are hit-or-miss\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND NETWORK\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 is available to order now on the company's website. In the\nUS, the base model with eight gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage costs $599.\nYou can upgrade to 12 gigs of RAM and 256 of storage for $699, or 12/512 for\n$799. It comes in either white or gray, though the $599 version with eight gigs\nof RAM only comes in gray.\n\nWhile it's currently just available direct from Nothing, the Phone 2 is\ncertified for use on both AT&T and T-Mobile. It's not certified for Verizon's\nnetwork. You can still use it on Verizon, and sub-6 5G connectivity will work\njust fine. But the Nothing Phone 2 lacks support for LTE band 13, which is\nimportant for Verizon's 4G coverage. If you're on Verizon (or an MVNO that uses\nits network) and depend on 4G connectivity, the Nothing Phone 2 probably won't\nwork for you.\n\n\nDESIGN AND DISPLAY\n\nnothing-phone-2-rear-1\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-rear-1.jpg]\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 carries on the distinct design language of the Phone 1, with\na similar transparent back showing off some gussied-up internals and Nothing’s\ntrademark Glyph interface. The most immediately noticeable differences from one\ngeneration to the next are the Phone 2’s size — it’s got a 6.7” display, a bit\nlarger than the Phone 1’s 6.55” panel — and color options. While the Phone 1\ncame in white or black, the Phone 2 comes in white and the sort of smoky gray\nyou can see in the photos here.\n\nThat gray color helps show off an additional new detail: the components under\nthe transparent back panel have more texture than they did in the Phone 1, which\nmakes the Phone 2 all the more visually appealing, with light playing on the\ntiny bumps and ridges in interesting ways. Unlike the Phone 1, which had flat\nglass on the back, the Phone 2’s back panel curves slightly at the edges to meet\nthe iPhone-style flat aluminum frame (Nothing calls it “pillowed glass”). I\nthink the Phone 1's flat back was a cleaner look, personally.\n\nThe Glyph lights on the back of the phone are a little different this time\naround, with an updated layout and more individually controllable zones than the\nNothing Phone 1 had. They still only light up in one color, though — these\naren’t tiny RGB strips.\n\nAside from those differences, the aesthetic here is very much in line with the\nNothing Phone 1. Nothing tells me this was intentional; the company wants to\nestablish a firm, recognizable visual identity that can extend to future\ngenerations of devices. I can’t complain there. Even if it’s not radically\ndifferent year-over-year, Nothing’s design language is still unique and striking\ncompared to most other phones today.\n\nThe hardware feels quality, too: there's no creaking or flexing, the buttons are\nclicky, and the haptics are nice and firm, if a little loud. The phone is IP54\nrated, so it's splashproof, but you still try not to submerge it in water.\n\nnothing-phone-2-threads-app\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-threads-app.jpg]\n\nThe Phone 2's display is a 6.7\", 120Hz OLED panel. It's a little larger than the\nPhone 1's screen, and the hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera is centered\nthis time, rather than tucked into the top left corner. It's a good screen:\ncolors are vibrant, viewing angles are good, and 1080p is plenty crisp. There's\nalso a plastic screen protector pre-installed. The protector on my review unit\nwas scratched up within hours of unboxing the phone and I ended up removing it a\nfew days later, but it's still a nice little bonus.\n\nThere's an optical fingerprint sensor near the bottom of the screen. The scanner\nis just a touch lower in the display than I'd like, but it's a good one: it's\nfaster and more reliable than the sensors in Google's Pixel 7 phones, though not\nquite as quick as the ultrasonic scanners Samsung uses in its flagships.\n\n\nSOFTWARE AND PERFORMANCE\n\nnothing-phone-2-home-screen-1\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-home-screen-1.jpg]\n\nNothing’s software looks fundamentally the same on the Phone 2 as it did on the\nPhone 1. The company’s applied the same light touch to customizing Android 13\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/android-13/] as it did Android 12: the UI here\nfeels a lot like Google’s flavor of Android. If that's still too exotic for your\ntaste, you have the option to choose stock Android over Nothing OS when you're\nfirst setting the phone up.\n\nI like Nothing OS, though; none of the tweaks Nothing makes get in the way or\nfeel forced. While the Phone 2 mostly uses Google’s system apps — Phone,\nMessages, Calculator, Clock, and more — there are a couple of Nothing-branded\napps and a handful of widgets in the company’s distinct dot-matrix style. And\nmercifully, there’s no bloat: no preinstalled games or social media, and no apps\nthat double up on functionality (looking at you, Samsung).\n\nThere’s no bloat: no preinstalled games or social media, and no apps that double\nup on functionality.\n\nYou have the option to add Nothing’s widgets to your lock screen, though I don’t\nknow that any of them are useful enough to justify giving up notification real\nestate — and I wish it wasn't limited to just Nothing's own. You can also blow\nup individual app and folder icons on your home screen to fill four spots rather\nthan one if you want, and Nothing’s launcher has a feature that optionally\nforces all your app icons to show as monochrome, even those that don’t yet\nsupport dynamic themes. You can also use standard icons, proper Material You\ntheming, or custom icon packs from the Play Store.\n\nNothing promises three years of Android updates — that'll see the Phone 2\nthrough Android 16 — and four years of bi-monthly security patches. Nothing has\nonly existed as a company since 2020, though, and released its first phone just\nlast year, so it's hard to predict what long-term support will look like. That\nsaid, the Phone 1 is yet to fall behind on updates, and I'm hopeful Nothing will\nbe able to deliver.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 is powered by a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset and either eight\nor 12 gigs of RAM. The 8+ Gen 1 was Qualcomm's 2022 flagship CPU, found in\ndevices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review/] and the OnePlus\n10T [https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-10t-review/]. It's not as powerful as\nthis year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, but the Phone 2 is still a remarkably snappy\ndevice. Apps don't feel remotely slow to open, multitasking works great, and\ngaming performance is reliably smooth.\n\nMy review unit is the $699 model that comes with 12 GB of RAM, but I don't think\nmost people would miss those four extra gigs. If you happen to need more than\n128 gigabytes of storage, the added RAM is nice headroom to have, but otherwise,\nyou should be safe with the $599 base model.\n\n\nGLYPH INTERFACE\n\nNothing’s Glyph interface is back in the Phone 2. The basic principle is the\nsame: under the transparent rear glass, you'll find strips of LEDs. When you get\na notification, they light up. You can assign different notifications different\nlight patterns, and create custom ringtone/Glyph combos using Nothing’s Glyph\nComposer feature. The Flip to Glyph feature from the Phone 1 makes a comeback,\ntoo: when you put the Nothing Phone 2 face down, your notifications are\nsilenced, letting the Glyph lights do all the work.\n\nnothing-phone-2-glyph-1\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-glyph-1.jpg]\n\nThere are a few handy new additions, though. You can configure notification\nchannels from any app as Essential Notifications, which make one of the Glyph\nstrips light up and stay lit until you view or dismiss them. That alone makes\nthe Glyph lights much more useful — you can keep your phone face down and still\nknow at a glance whether it needs your attention.\n\nThere’s a new Glyph Timer feature that uses one of the Glyph strips as a sort of\nprogress bar for timers, though, strangely, only ones you set from a certain\nwidget or the phone's settings, not from the Clock app. Nothing’s also built an\nexperimental feature for the Uber app that shows your ride’s progress using the\nGlyph interface. I haven’t had the chance to try that yet; it’s neat in theory,\nbut I imagine I’d still be keeping a close eye on my phone’s screen if I were\nwaiting for a ride.\n\nnothing-phone-2-glyph-2\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-glyph-2.jpg]\n\nIn all, the Glyph lights don't add a ton of utility; a single notification LED\non the back of the phone would more or less accomplish the same thing. But they\nlook cool, and they don't detract from any other aspect of the phone. It might\nbe a gimmick, but at least it's a harmless one.\n\n\nCAMERAS\n\nnothing-phone-2-cameras-1\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-cameras-1.jpg]\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 has two 50-megapixel rear cameras: one primary at f/1.9 and\none ultrawide at f/2.2. Photo performance is mixed.\n\nIn good light, the Phone 2 typically takes good pictures. Colors look natural,\ndetail is sharp, and shadows are refreshingly dark — while many smartphone\ncameras aggressively brighten darker areas in photos, the Phone 2 is content to\nlet them fall to near-black a lot of the time. I appreciate that.\n\nThings get a little trickier in more challenging lighting conditions. While the\nPhone 2 is using tried-and-true camera hardware (its primary shooter uses the\nsame sensor as the OnePlus 11\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-11-review/]), Nothing's photo processing\nneeds work. In high-contrast scenes, it's not unusual to lose detail in both\nhighlights and shadows.\n\nThree sets of standard vs. ultrawide shots.\n\nThe cameras also tend to use excessively long exposures in dark settings. That's\nsort of a good thing: a longer exposure means a brighter photo. But I've seen\nshutter speeds for single exposures as slow as 1/5. At such low speeds, even\nwith optical image stabilization, it's hard to get a clear handheld photo.\n\nShutter lag is an intermittent problem as well. Even in relatively bright light,\nthe Phone 2 will often take a beat to actually snap a photo after you press the\nshutter button. It's not always an issue, but I've missed a few pictures of\nmoving subjects because of an unexpected half-second pause before the phone took\nmy photo.\n\nPortrait mode.\n\nThese cameras aren't bad; I've taken plenty of pictures I really like with the\nNothing Phone 2. But even at their best, they can't quite compete with other\nphones in this price range. Hell, last year's Pixel 6a takes appreciably better\nphotos most of the time — and that phone has been as cheap as $250 on sale.\n\n\nBATTERY AND CHARGING\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 comes with a 4,700mAh battery that, for me, has no trouble\nmaking it through at least a full day of use. I've consistently gotten six-plus\nhours of screen time across 24 or more hours away from a charger — and that\nfigure holds true even with battery-intensive tasks like gaming and Google Maps\nnavigation in the mix. With light use, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see the\nPhone 2 make it a full 48 hours between charges.\n\nnothing-phone-2-battery-stats\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-battery-stats.jpg]\n\nThere's 45-watt fast charging here that Nothing says can get the Phone 2's\nbattery from zero to 100 in under an hour. That speed does require a PPS charger\nthat can deliver power at 2.25 amps, though, and not all can. At 5A, charging is\nlimited to 15 watts. A full charge at 15 watts takes about an hour and 15\nminutes. The Phone 2's also got wireless charging at up to 15 watts, plus\nreverse wireless charging at up to five watts.\n\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nAt a starting price of $599, the Nothing Phone 2 offers a compelling blend of\nstyle and performance. Google's Pixel 7\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-7-review/] also starts at $599. The\nPixel offers much better camera performance and Google's killer software\nfeatures like Assistant-powered call screening. It's also guaranteed security\npatches until October 2027, more than a year longer than Nothing's July 2026\ntarget, and is fully compatible with Verizon, 4G and all. But the Nothing Phone\n2 has longer battery life and a larger, faster display — 120Hz to the Pixel 7's\n90.\n\nThe OnePlus 11 retails for $699, but it's often available for the same $599 the\nNothing Phone 2 costs at launch. The OnePlus 11 is a little quicker, has a\nhigher-resolution 1440p display, and generally better camera performance (plus a\n2x telephoto lens). It's also got crazy-fast wired charging at 80W with the\nincluded charger. The Nothing Phone 2 has wireless charging, though; the OnePlus\n11 doesn't. And OnePlus's OxygenOS is a more heavily customized version of\nAndroid than Nothing OS, if stock-ness matters to you.\n\n\nSHOULD YOU BUY IT?\n\nGiven the Nothing Phone 2's strong performance, competitive price point, and\ngenerally okay cameras, it's easy to see parallels with the phones OnePlus was\nmaking back in its \"flagship killer\" days, then under Nothing founder Carl Pei's\nleadership. I think this phone will appeal to the same type of enthusiast\ncustomers who liked OnePlus's early phones: people who want a viable,\ninteresting alternative to more mainstream options at a fair price. General\navailability in the US is going to expose the Phone 2 to a bigger pool of those\nenthusiasts than the Nothing Phone 1 enjoyed, too, and I'm interested to see how\nit affects the upper-midrange market it's competing in.\n\nBut that market is more crowded than it was years ago, and while the Nothing\nPhone 2 punches above its weight on performance, display quality, and style,\ncamera quality isn't quite up to snuff compared to other phones that cost about\nthe same — or even less. Missing LTE band 13 compatibility and Verizon\ncertification will also naturally put off a lot of Verizon subscribers, and the\nGlyph lights on the back of the phone, neat as they are, really don't add much\nto the experience. There's clear room for improvement in these areas, even\nconsidering the Phone 2's sub-flagship price.\n\nnothing-phone-2-glyph-4\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-glyph-4.jpg]\n\nOverall, though, I really like the Nothing Phone 2. It's fast, it lasts all day,\nand it doesn't look quite like any other phone on the market — at least not here\nin the US. If you're not on Verizon (or you're really confident in Verizon's 5G\ncoverage), and you don't need the most camera you can get for the money, the\nNothing Phone 2 is a really good phone at $599.\n\nnothing-phone-2-square\n[https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-square.jpg]\n\nNOTHING PHONE 2\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2 is Nothing's second phone, but the company's first to be\nsold in the United States. At a starting price of $599, it's got a lot to offer,\nincluding a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset, a 120Hz OLED display, 45W fast\ncharging, and a unique design. "

Sales are down.\n\n“The stake through the heart of Anchor was the pandemic,” Singer told\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/dining/anchor-brewing-closing-beer.html] the\nNew York Times. He added that 70% of the company’s products had been sold to\nrestaurants and bars, which suffered in the years since the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe company was on the verge of bankruptcy in the 1960s, with the headlines in\nthe San Francisco Chronicle\n[https://www.sfchronicle.com/oursf/article/anchor-steam-comeback-story-18194861.php]\nin 1959 spelling its fate: “Last Steam Beer – An Institution Dies.” It had\nalready survived through San Francisco’s historic earthquake, which destroyed\nits operations, and the prohibition era. But after Fritz Maytag acquired the\nbrewery in 1965, the storied company ushered in an era of specialty beer\npopularity, guided by its popular pale ale and its bold Christmas ale.\n\nHarry Schuhmacher [https://beernet.com/team/harry-schuhmacher/], publisher of\nthe trade publication Craft Business Daily, told CNN\n[https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/12/business/anchor-brewing-shutting-down/index.html]\nthat the end of Anchor represented a “sad day in the history of craft brewing in\nAmerica”.\n\n“I know Fritz must be heartbroken,” Schuhmacher added. “He literally nurtured\nthat brewery from insolvency in the 60s to becoming San Francisco’s hometown\nbeer and symbolic of America’s craft beer resurgence.”\n\nDuring the pandemic, they rebranded and sold its products in grocery stores. But\nin the last month, the company limited its distribution to California and ceased\n[https://vinepair.com/articles/hop-take-anchor-brewing-future/] making its\npopular Christmas ale after 50 years.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n[https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/13/anchor-brewing-closing-beer-san-francisco#EmailSignup-skip-link-12]\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nAnchor ultimately “couldn’t make up for the significant loss of sales”, Singer\ntold the New York Times. “The bottom line is that Anchor ran out of money, and\nit ran out of time.”\n\nThe company has given its 61 workers 60 days’ notice and would continue to sell\nwhatever beer remains in its possession through the end of July.\n\nOver the years, Sapporo made “repeated efforts” to sell Anchor, without luck.\nAnchor’s statement left open hope that history would repeat itself, noting it\nwas “possible that a buyer will step forward for the brewery as part of the\nliquidation process”.\n\n“It takes a lot of creativity, nimbleness and no small amount of luck for\nbreweries, even great ones, to survive all storms and remain the choice of the\npeople,” said Oliver. “I hope they climb back somehow.”"

        "content": "Chet Holmgren couldn’t help himself. The No. 2 overall pick in the 2022 NBA\nDraft [https://www.sbnation.com/nba-draft] was just months away from starting a\nhighly anticipated rookie season when he showed up to Seattle to play in Jamal\nCrawford’s pro-am run. Paolo Banchero (the only player picked ahead of Holmgren\nin the draft) was playing, too. So were LeBron James and Jayson Tatum. There\nwere no real stakes in the gym that day, but Holmgren simply has no way of\ndialing back his competitive juices.\n\nThe gym was overcrowded, and the floor was slippery due to condensation\n[https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2022/8/22/23315726/lebron-james-seattle-crawsover-jamal-crawford-pro-am-video-highlights-story].\nStill, when James attacked in transition and Holmgren was back as the only\ndefender, the young Oklahoma City Thunder big man fought with everything he had\nto deny the shot [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMRyU1dkoIY]. Then he came up\nlimping.\n\nHolmgren would be diagnosed with a Lisfranc injury and miss the entirety of what\nshould have been his rookie year\n[https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2022/8/25/23321524/chet-holmgren-injury-pro-am-crawsover-lisfranc-foot-video].\nThe Thunder thrived anyway, jumping from a 24-win team to a 40-win team behind a\nsuperstar leap from guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. As the Thunder’s surge was\nhappening, it was easy to wonder just how much better the team would have been\nwith Holmgren in the lineup.\n\nHolmgren is finally healthy, and he’s using NBA Summer League\n[http://www.sbnation.com/nba-summer-league] to shake off the rust. On Wednesday\nnight in Las Vegas, Holmgren issued a warning shot on both his spectacular\ntalent and the imminent ascent of the Thunder. This is the player Oklahoma City\nhas been waiting for.\n\n\n\nHolmgren finished the night with 25 points, nine rebounds, five blocks, and two\nassists on 9-of-15 shooting from the floor. It was mostly a full showcase of the\nall-around skill set that makes Holmgren such a two-way force on the floor, save\nfor the fact that he missed both of his three-point attempts. Those are going to\nfall eventually, and it’s only going to make Holmgren even tougher to handle.\n\nThere is no easy historical comparison for Holmgren. At 7’1 with a 7’6 wingspan,\nhe’s fully comfortable handling the ball on the perimeter, taking threes, and\nmaking quick passing reads. Holmgren is also excellent at traditional big man\nskills: he’s a monster rim protector on defense, and a skilled finisher around\nthe rim on offense. He’s going to put an enormous amount of pressure on the rim\nas a roll man, and he barely has to jump to dunk with a reported 9’6 standing\nreach.\n\nYes, Holmgren is still very thin even after spending his injury year bulking up\nwith muscle. There are going to times when he gets dunked on and the clip goes\nviral on social media — but that’s only because Chet tries to block everything\nand doesn’t care about being embarrassed. On a wider scale, Holmgren projects as\none of the very best shot blockers in the NBA one day. He’s extremely quick to\nthe ball with his rotations, has tremendous hand placement on his blocks, and\nhe’s never going to back down regardless of who is attacking the rim.\n\nIt’s incredible to think the Thunder’s rise last season happened without anyone\nresembling a real center on the roster. Of the top eight players in total\nminutes on Oklahoma City\n[https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/OKC/2023.html], only Josh Giddey — a\nguard — was taller than 6’6. Now a team already stacked with big guards and\nwings is adding a 7’1 monster inside who can put a lid on the rim and dunk home\nany lob with his enormous catch radius. Of course, Holmgren’s game is so much\nmore diverse than that.\n\nHolmgren may not score 30 points per game at any point in his career, but he’s\ngoing to have a superstar impact regardless if he can stay healthy. Instead,\nHolmgren is the preeminent supersized connector of this era, someone who will do\nall the little things to help teams win while being taller and longer than\nanyone on the court. He’ll space the floor as a shooter, keep the ball moving as\na passer, hit the glass, and more than anything provide elite paint protection\non defense. The only other young player with a skill set this diverse is Victor\nWembanyama, and the whole world already knows he’s an alien.\n\nThe middle of July is too early for bold predictions, but let’s just say no one\nshould be surprised if OKC takes another big leap up the standings this year.\nThey already have a superstar in Gilgeous-Alexander, and the rest of their young\ncore is developing wonderfully around him. The addition of Holmgren can take the\nteam to the next level. It isn’t out of bounds to believe this team can compete\nfor championships in the next few years.\n\nHolmgren has to stay healthy, of course, and that’s a big if. One of his\ngreatest assets — his competitive spirit — can also be his downfall if he\ndoesn’t learn to pick his spots. Hopefully a year away from the game taught him\nthat much. If he can do it, the Thunder have the piece their rebuild has been\nmissing. There’s no cap on what could come next."

GLAAD also\ncriticized Spacey, with the org’s CEO Sarah Kate Ellis saying at the time:\n“Coming-out stories should not be used to deflect from allegations of sexual\nassault.”\n\nSpacey told the U.K. court on Thursday that after he was approached by Buzzfeed\nregarding Rapp’s allegation he had a series of calls with his team – including\nlawyers, publicists and business managers – to decide how to respond.\n\n“People were being professionals and they did their best,” Spacey told the U.K,\ncourt on Thursday but added: “I was under a lot of pressure that I had to say\nsomething. That it would be a PR nightmare if I didn’t.”\n\nHe said some members of his team disagreed with the course of action but they\ntook a vote and ultimately released a statement in which Spacey revealed he was\ngay.\n\n“I understand why people responded the way they did to it,” Spacey said.\n\nSpacey added that he had been planning to come out publicly for a long time and\nhad considered doing it two years earlier at an event (which he didn’t name).\n“The gay community had been pressuring me for a very long time about coming\nout,” he said.\n\nThe actor added that he hadn’t planned to come out in response to the Buzzfeed\nstory but had hoped it would at least “do something at least positive [and] put\nthe question of my sexuality behind me.”\n\n“Maybe now the allegation against me by Anthony Rapp has been proven to be\nfalse, maybe people will read that statement with a little bit more\nunderstanding now,” he said.\n\nRapp lost a $40 million sexual battery lawsuit against Spacey last October.\n\nDuring his first day in the witness stand on Thursday, Spacey said he had hardly\nworked in the six years since Rapp first spoke to Buzzfeed.\n\nAsked by his barrister, Patrick Gibbs KC, whether he had once been a rich man,\nSpacey replied: “I was very fortunate in the career I had.”\n\n“Are you a rich man now?” asked Gibbs.\n\nCiting his lack of income and large legal bills, Spacey simply replied: “No.”"

First, let's take a quick look back at the\nseason's first half. Remember back in spring training when a subsection of\nbaseball fandom freaked out about the changes, namely the pitch clock? Those\nconcerns have fallen by the wayside for the overwhelming majority of fans. As\nmore than one player has pointed out in the last several months, the pace of\nplay isn't rushed, it just isn't moving along at a snail's pace. \n\nBatting average is up, runs per game are up, attendance is up and the average\ntime of the game has dropped significantly. It appears to be working with the\ngeneral public: \n\n * Attendance is up 8.06% year over year. \n * There have been four straight weekends of over 1.5 million in attendance, the\n   first time that has happened since 2017. \n * MLB.tv is up 9% on minutes watched over last season.\n * Local ratings for the 29 US-based teams are up 3%, despite all the issues\n   with local channels (RSNs). \n * An MLB [https://cbssports.com/mlb/] survey found 86% of people in the 18-24\n   and 25-34 age brackets said they are more likely to watch MLB now due to the\n   rule changes with similar numbers on them being more likely to attend games. \n\nI agree to receive the \"CBS Sports HQ Newsletter\" and marketing communications,\nupdates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from\nCBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.\n\nBy pressing sign up, I confirm that I have read and agree to the Terms of Use\n[https://legal.paramount.com/us/en/cbsi/terms-of-use] and acknowledge\nParamount's Privacy Policy [https://privacy.paramount.com/en/policy].\n\nPlease check the opt-in box to acknowledge that you would like to subscribe.\n\n\nTHANKS FOR SIGNING UP!\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON YOUR INBOX.\n\n\n\n\nSORRY!\n\nTHERE WAS AN ERROR PROCESSING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.\n\n\n\nThat means the product itself has a chance to grab hold of the audience and\ncreate some lifelong fans. There is a ton of opportunity here even if we limited\nit to just the team level. \n\n * New blood is always fun. The Reds\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/] sit in first place\n   in the NL Central and haven't made the playoffs in a full season since 2013.\n   The Marlins [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/] hold the\n   top NL wild-card spot and haven't made the full-season playoffs since 2003.\n   Few expected the Diamondbacks\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ARI/arizona-diamondbacks/] to be a\n   strong contender and they are tied for first in the NL West. Even fewer\n   expected the Rangers [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/]\n   to sit in first place above the defending champs, but there they are. The\n   Orioles [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/] are\n   really strong and haven't been to the playoffs since 2016. \n * Big-time brands are helpful, too. The Braves\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/] won it all in 2021\n   and won 100-plus games last season. They look better than both of those teams\n   right now and are all kinds of fun to watch. The Dodgers\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/] are tied for\n   first place. The Astros\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/] are again in\n   playoff position. The Yankees\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/] are only a game\n   out of the last AL wild card and the Red Sox\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/] are two back. The\n   defending NL champion Phillies\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/] are a game\n   back. The Giants\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SF/san-francisco-giants/] are in playoff\n   position. \n * If the above group contains some villains in the eyes of many fans (notably\n   the Yankees, Dodgers and Astros for varying reasons), how about the\n   lower-payroll types that keep finding success? The Guardians\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/] are in first,\n   again, in the AL Central while the Rays\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TB/tampa-bay-rays/] used a 13-0 start to\n   propel them to the top of the mighty AL East all season to this point. \n * Can one of the hyped preseason teams who have disappointed make a miracle\n   run? We're talking about the Mets\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/] and/or Padres\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/]. \n * There is all kinds of intrigue around the Angels\n   [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAA/los-angeles-angels/] and you know\n   who. \n\nAnd so much more! It's possible the World Series champion wasn't even mentioned,\ngiven that the Brewers\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/], Mariners\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/], Twins\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/] and Blue Jays\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/] are contending. \n\nIt is going to be an amazingly fun and -- dare I say -- unpredictable second\nhalf in the 2023 Major League Baseball season. It's going to happen in front of\na lot of extra eyeballs this time around, too. Let's get to it! \n\nBiggest Movers\n\nRk\n\nTeams\n\nChg\n\nRcrd\n\n1 Braves [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/] Remember when\nthe Rays were the easy and obvious No. 1 every single week here for a bit? The\nBraves hit the All-Star break with a FOUR-game lead over the Rays for the best\nrecord in baseball. A 27-5 run to close the first half will do that. -- 60-29 2\nOrioles [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/] The Orioles\nare two games out, but they are tied in the loss column. I'll give them the nod\nhere for a few reasons. First, they are better in the last month and have added\nsome new, young talent. Meanwhile, the Rays pitcher injuries are really starting\nto hinder them. If we wanted to look head-to-head, the Orioles win that battle\nthree games to two. And, finally, my last-resort tiebreaker is who I'd predict\nto win a seven-game series right now. I'd take the Orioles. 4 54-35 3 Rays\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TB/tampa-bay-rays/] They lost seven of\neight before the break and surely felt like they needed the rest. The Orioles\nare right on their ass, too. The good news for the Rays is they should have a\nsoft landing here for the second half, starting with a three-game series in\nKansas City. 1 58-35 4 Marlins\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/] Other than when they\nlose to the Braves (which is no crime; everyone does), they just keep winning.\nAnd for the \"unsustainable\" people, who have arrived at that conclusion by\nlooking at run differential and nothing deeper, the Marlins have a plus-52 run\ndifferential in their last 43 games. The season-long total is skewed by roughly\nfour losses early in the season. Are we really going to act like four games from\nthe start of the season through May 3 can predict the rest of the season? Look\ndeeper. Be better. 3 53-39 5 Dodgers\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAD/los-angeles-dodgers/] Mookie Betts hit\n.365/.471/1.039 with eight doubles, nine homers, 19 RBI and 18 runs in his last\n15 games before the break. Ignore the Home Run Derby performance. He's on a\nheater when it matters. 3 51-38 6 Rangers\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/] Tough first-half finish\nfor the Rangers, as they went 5-11 after June 23. They are fortunate they bought\nthemselves so much cushion after an excellent start. A big homestand is on tap\nhere to start the second half against three playoff-caliber teams (Guardians,\nRays and Dodgers). 3 52-39 7 Diamondbacks\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ARI/arizona-diamondbacks/] Let's hope\nCorbin Carroll's shoulder holds it together. 3 52-39 8 Astros\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/] Can a team in the\nsecond wild-card spot be a sleeping giant? Because they really feel like a\nsleeping giant. 3 50-41 9 Phillies\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/] Kyle Schwarber\nis hitting .184 with 22 bombs. The only players to ever top 30 homers with a\nsub-.200 batting average are Joey Gallo (.199, 38 HR, 2021), Eugenio Suarez\n(.198, 31 HR, 2021) and Mark Reynolds (.198, 32 HR, 2010). 3 48-41 10 Red Sox\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/] James Paxton and\nBrayan Bello are a very nice 1-2 punch in the rotation right now, just like\neveryone drew it up. 3 48-43 11 Blue Jays\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/] Are you ready to\nargue that a Home Run Derby fixed a player? Because Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is\ngoing to have a monster second half. Look, if you're gonna blame the Derby\nanytime a player has a slump afterward, it's gotta go both ways. 3 50-41 12\nBrewers [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/] The Brewers\nwon 11 of their last 17 games before the break, including taking the Reds down\nin two of three. They'll get the Reds again to start the second half, too. 3\n49-42 13 Reds [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/] The\nReds lead the majors with 112 stolen bases. Elly De La Cruz has 16 in only 30\ngames. 3 50-41 14 Yankees\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/] For me, the\noffensive issues are due to age (read: Old), personnel and Aaron Judge's injury,\nbut it'll be fun to see if Sean Casey makes a difference now as hitting coach. 3\n49-42 15 Giants [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SF/san-francisco-giants/]\nThe Giants lost seven of their last 11 heading to the break, but let's be\nhonest: Sitting eight games over .500 right now is a net positive. 6 49-41 16\nMariners [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/] Well lookie\nwhat we have here! The Mariners are 7-2 with a plus-25 run differential in July\nand all three opponents are currently in playoff position. Can they keep it\ngoing? 3 45-44 17 Guardians\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CLE/cleveland-guardians/] The Guardians\nwere 5 1/2 games back of the Twins on June 2. As they chipped and chipped away\nin the ensuing weeks, I just kept thinking one thing: We've seen this movie\nbefore. -- 45-45 18 Twins\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIN/minnesota-twins/] Before this season,\nthe lowest first-half OPS of Carlos Correa's career was .803. This season it was\n.700. -- 45-46 19 Angels\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/LAA/los-angeles-angels/] They were fully on\ncourse to be strong buyers ahead of the trade deadline and, perhaps most\nimportantly, would've been able to avoid the Shohei Ohtani trade talk. And then\nthey lost nine of their last 10 and Mike Trout got hurt. 3 45-46 20 Padres\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/] Is it too late?\nEverything about this team screams that it should be much better. Winning five\nof six heading into the break provides some hope. They need to get much hotter\nthan that, though. 3 43-47 21 Cubs\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/] Cody Bellinger's last 15\ngames before the break: .436/.467/.600. Since the Cubs are likely sellers,\nagain, expect to see his name a lot the next two weeks. 1 42-47 22 Mets\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/] That six-game winning\nstreak crawled the Mets back to within a gasp of the playoff picture, but losing\nthose last two really hurt. It's still possible, but they've gotta get really\nhot really quickly. -- 42-48 23 Pirates\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-pirates/] Paul Skenes\ncertainly seems worth the excitement, so there's that. 2 41-49 24 Cardinals\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/STL/st-louis-cardinals/] I took under 89\nwins for this group heading into the season and it seems that it won't take much\nlonger until I win. I am obviously the smartest man alive. -- 38-52 25 Tigers\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/] There's been a lot of\nbad news with the big-league roster here in the last few years, but let's not\ngloss over Riley Greene. The fifth overall pick out of high school in 2019 is\nhitting .305 with a 133 OPS+ at age 22. -- 39-50 26 Nationals\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/WAS/washington-nationals/] Through his\nfirst 80 games this season, Joey Meneses had two home runs. In his last three\ngames before the All-Star break, he hit four. -- 36-54 27 White Sox\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHW/chicago-white-sox/] Luis Robert is\nhaving an MVP-type season and is young enough to be the franchise centerpiece\nthrough the upcoming rebuild. I'd trade just about anyone else off the MLB\nroster who would bring value back. -- 38-54 28 Rockies\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/COL/colorado-rockies/] They are on pace to\ngo 61-101. The franchise record for losses in a season is 98. -- 34-57 29 Royals\n[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/KC/kansas-city-royals/] They are on pace to\ngo 46-116.

        "content": " * Associated Press\n\nJul 13, 2023, 10:04 AM ET\n\nLONDON -- There was a time when Ons Jabeur\n[https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=1803] might not\nhave recovered from the deficit she found herself in during the Wimbledon\nsemifinals. Down a set. Down a break. So close to being just a game from defeat.\n\nShe credits her sports psychologist with helping her understand how to deal with\nthose on-court situations, with managing to keep her focus, keep her strokes\non-target. Thanks in part to that, and a steadiness down the stretch at Centre\nCourt on Thursday, Jabeur is on her way to a second consecutive final at the All\nEngland Club and her third title match in the past five Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nNow she wants to win a trophy. The sixth-seeded Jabeur earned the right to play\nfor one again by beating big-hitting Aryna Sabalenka\n[https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3038] 6-7 (5), 6-4,\n6-3.\n\n\"I'm very proud of myself, because maybe old me would have lost the match today\nand went back home already. But I'm glad that I kept digging very deep and\nfinding the strength,\" said Jabeur, a 28-year-old from Tunisia who is the only\nArab woman and only North African woman to reach a major final.\n\n\"I'm learning to transform the bad energy into a good one,\" Jabeur said,\nexplaining that she was able to get over the anger she felt after the first set.\n\"Some things I have no control over: She can ace any time. She can hit the big\nserve, even if I have a break point. That's frustrating a bit. But I'm glad that\nI'm accepting it and I'm digging deep to just go and win this match -- and,\nhopefully, this tournament.\"\n\nTo do that, Jabeur will need to get past Marketa Vondrousova\n[http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2735], a left-hander\nfrom the Czech Republic, on Saturday. Vondrousova became the first unseeded\nwomen's finalist at Wimbledon since Billie Jean King in 1963 by eliminating\nElina Svitolina\n[http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=1797] 6-3, 6-3\nearlier Thursday.\n\nSo far, Jabeur is 0-2 in Slam finals after losing to Elena Rybakina\n[https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3126] at the All\nEngland Club last July and to Iga Swiatek\n[https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3730] at the US\nOpen last September.\n\nJabeur's victory Thursday, which came by collecting 10 of the last 13 games,\nprevented No. 2 Sabalenka from replacing Swiatek at No. 1 in the rankings.\nSabalenka came into the match with a 17-1 record at majors in 2023, including a\ntrophy at the Australian Open.\n\nJabeur trailed 4-2 in the second set when she began to turn things around. But\nnot before Sabalenka came within a point from leading 5-3 after Jabeur put a\nforehand into the net and fell onto her back on the grass of Centre Court.\n\nShe dusted herself off and broke to take that game and begin her big comeback.\nWhen she delivered a backhand return winner to force the match to a third set,\nJabeur held her right index finger to her ear, then raised it and wagged it as\nshe strutted to the changeover.\n\nSabalenka's shots missed the mark repeatedly. She finished with far more\nunforced errors than Jabeur: The margins were 14-5 in the last set and 45-15 for\nthe match.\n\nA break put Jabeur up 4-2 in the third, but there was still some work to be\ndone. Sabalenka, as powerful a ball-striker as there is on tour, erased four\nmatch points before Jabeur converted her fifth with a 103 mph ace.\n\nIn the first semifinal, Vondrousova reeled off seven consecutive games in one\nstretch. She is ranked 43rd and reached the second Grand Slam final of her\ncareer after getting that far as a teenager at the 2019 French Open.\n\n\"I was crazy nervous,\" said Vondrousova, who bowed her head and knelt at the\nbaseline when the match was over. \"I was nervous, actually, the whole match.\"\n\nRanked No. 76 and an unseeded wild-card recipient, Svitolina returned to the\ntour from maternity leave just three months ago. After surprisingly beating\nSwiatek in the quarterfinals, she was trying to become the first woman from\nUkraine to make it to the title match at a major tennis tournament.\n\n\"She's such a fighter,\" said Vondrousova, who compiled a 22-9 edge in total\nwinners, \"and she's also such a great person.\"\n\nSvitolina received loud support from thousands in the crowd at the main stadium\n-- Ukraine's ambassador to Britain was in the Royal Box -- as applause and yells\nechoed off the closed roof.\n\nSvitolina has said that she is playing more freely and more calmly nowadays,\nsomething she attributed to having the dual motivations of playing for her baby\ndaughter, who was born in October, and of trying to bring happiness to people in\nher home country, where an ongoing war began with Russia's invasion in February\n2022.\n\n\"It's a lot of responsibility, a lot of tension. I try to balance it as much as\nI can. Sometimes it gets maybe too much,\" Svitolina said. \"But I don't want to\n(make it) an excuse.\"\n\nFrom 3-all in the opening set Thursday, Svitolina's level began to dip, while\nVondrousova's rose. Over the ensuing half-hour, Vondrousova was in complete\ncontrol, so much so that she took that set and pulled ahead 4-0 in the next.\n\nSuddenly, though, Svitolina got within 4-3.\n\nVondrousova put an end to that mini-streak by collecting the last two games. She\nmissed about six months last season because of two operations on her left wrist,\nbut is back at the height of her powers and back in the spotlight of a Grand\nSlam final.\n\nShe came to England last year with a cast on that arm to enjoy London as a\ntourist and to watch her best friend and doubles partner, Miriam Kolodziejova\n[https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=7830], play in the\nqualifying rounds at Wimbledon.\n\n\"It's not always easy to come back. You don't know if you can play at this level\nand if you can be back at the top and back at these tournaments,\" Vondrousova\nsaid. \"I just feel like I'm just grateful to be on a court again, to play\nwithout pain.\"\n\nAsked how she plans to prepare for Saturday, Vondrousova laughed.\n\n\"I'm just going to chill now,\" she replied."

        "content": "If you’re trying to beat the heat this summer, you might want to reconsider what\nyou’re eating and drinking.\n\nA punishing summer heat wave\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/07/11/heat-florida-arizona-texas-california-southwest-forecast/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3]\nis baking large swaths of the country, exposing millions of Americans to\ntriple-digit temperatures. Experts say making sure that you’re properly hydrated\nand your body has enough energy is essential to helping you weather the physical\ntoll of extreme heat\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/climate-change-humidity/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3].\n\nHere are some do’s and don’ts.\n\nDON’T ...\n\nEat big heavy meals. Digestion creates heat, and consuming large amounts of rich\nfoods in one sitting can be difficult for the body to break down, said Leigh A.\nFrame\n[https://apps.smhs.gwu.edu/smhs/facultydirectory/profile.cfm?empName=Leigh%20Frame&FacID=2075162956],\ndirector of integrative medicine at George Washington University. “If you’re\nstruggling to digest food, your body’s actually creating more heat.”\n\nEating a heavy meal when it’s really hot out can also make you feel more\nsluggish and tired because your body is trying to do too much at once, said\nCecilia Sorensen\n[https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/cecilia-j-sorensen-md], director\nof the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education at Columbia University.\n\nInstead, experts recommend eating lighter meals more frequently throughout the\nday and focusing on hydrating foods that can be easier to digest, such as\ncucumber and watermelon.\n\n“That is going to make people have more energy and not feel as fatigued during\nthe heat,” Sorensen said.\n\nConsume too much caffeine. Drinks with large amounts of caffeine, such as energy\ndrinks\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/11/prime-energy-drink-concerns-caffeine/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13],\ncan be dehydrating because they make you urinate more.\n\n“It depends on the amount of caffeine in them. For instance, the amount of\ncaffeine in a cup of coffee is not that much,” Frame said.\n\nThink ice-cold foods and drinks are the solution. Cooling down on a hot day with\nice cream, Popsicles or an icy drink might give you temporary relief.\n\n“It’s not like you can be out in the hot, hot sun, and humidity and just eat\ncold foods and be okay,” said Nate Wood\n[https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/nathan-wood/], a chef and instructor of\nmedicine at the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nAnd consuming a lot of cold foods or drinks in a single day could lower your\ncore temperature, Frame said. Your body might respond by trying to heat itself\nback up, which could drain your energy and make you feel warmer in the long run,\nshe said. Additionally, most ice cream contains dairy, which can be difficult\nfor many people to digest.\n\n“It would be better to use a cold compress on the back of your neck rather than\ntrying to ice yourself from the inside out,” she said.\n\nDO ...\n\nEat fruits and vegetables. Food can be a major source of hydration. Unlike\nprocessed foods, which typically don’t contain much water and can be harder to\ndigest, many fruits and vegetables are full of water and nutrition.\n\nExperts recommend eating produce with high water content, such as berries,\nwatermelon, cucumbers, tomatoes, celery and bell peppers. While lettuce is known\nto contain a lot of water, Wood said darker greens such as kale and spinach can\nalso be hydrating.\n\nThese foods have the added benefit that they don’t need to be cooked\n[https://washpost.arcpublishing.com/ellipsis/washingtonpost.com/food/2021/07/05/no-cook-recipes-summer/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28],\nso you can reduce the amount of heat generated inside your home.\n\nScientists say to brace for more extreme weather and possibly a record-warm 2023\namid unprecedented temperatures. (Video: John Farrell/The Washington Post)\n\nHydrate properly. Plain water and low-sugar, caffeine-free drinks are ideal,\nexperts say. Unless you’re playing a sport or exercising, you probably don’t\nneed an electrolyte drink, which often has added sugar.\n\nBut it’s important to be careful to avoid drinking too much water. Guzzling\nwater could cause a potentially fatal condition known as hyponatremia\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyponatremia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373711],\nwhich occurs when the sodium in your body becomes diluted and levels drop\nabnormally low.\n\nAside from feeling thirsty, the best way to know if you’re properly hydrated is\nto assess the color of your urine, Frame said. “If it is a very pale yellow,\nlike the color of light lemon juice, you are hydrated. If it is any darker than\nthat, then you are dehydrated.”\n\nThink about balance. Avoid making drastic changes to your diet, experts said.\n\nBeyond hydration, your body needs calories. Supplement hydrating foods with\nthings that are higher in unsaturated or healthy fats and lean proteins, Wood\nsaid.\n\nKeep in mind that if you suddenly start eating more fruits and vegetables than\nyou have before, your body could react poorly, he said. For example, eating way\nmore fiber than you’re used to could cause gastrointestinal issues such as\nbloating and cramping and changes to your bowel movements, he said.\n\n“One of the best things people can do is just kind of like start adopting these\ntypes of lifestyle and dietary modifications chronically, because these are\nhealthy for us anyway,” Wood said. “Then, when the time comes where that becomes\nreally important for literal survival, if not just comfort, you’re kind of\nalready acclimated to doing those things and it’s not such a shock to the body.”"

        "content": "During an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday morning, Disney\n[https://variety.com/t/disney/] CEO Bob Iger [https://variety.com/t/bob-iger/]\nsaid that the writers and actors unions going on strike in Hollywood are not\nbeing “realistic” with their expectations.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC’s David Faber from the Sun Valley Conference in Idaho, Iger\ncommented on the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike and imminent decision\nfor SAG-AFTRA to join them.\n\n“It’s very disturbing to me. We’ve talked about disruptive forces on this\nbusiness and all the challenges we’re facing, the recovery from COVID which is\nongoing, it’s not completely back. This is the worst time in the world to add to\nthat disruption,” Iger said. “I understand any labor organization’s desire to\nwork on behalf of its members to get the most compensation and be compensated\nfairly based on the value that they deliver. We managed, as an industry, to\nnegotiate a very good deal with the directors guild that reflects the value that\nthe directors contribute to this great business. We wanted to do the same thing\nwith the writers, and we’d like to do the same thing with the actors. There’s a\nlevel of expectation that they have, that is just not realistic. And they are\nadding to the set of the challenges that this business is already facing that\nis, quite frankly, very disruptive.”\n\nIt is expected that SAG-AFTRA, the actors union, will go on strike Thursday\nmorning\n[https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/sag-aftra-talks-break-down-1235658176/] after\ncontract talks concluded late Wednesday night without a resolution. This will\neffectively halt all scripted film and TV production, much of which had already\nbeen delayed due to the ongoing writers strike, which is in its third month.\nSAG-AFTRA has not gone on strike in over four decades, and the last time both\nunions were striking concurrently was in 1960.\n\nIger said that while he respects the right of the unions to “get as much as they\npossibly can in compensation for their people,” they must “be realistic about\nthe business environment, and what this business can deliver.”\n\nIger continued, “It will have a very, very damaging affect on the whole\nbusiness, and unfortunately, there’s huge collateral damage in the industry to\npeople who are supportive services, and I could go on and on. It will affect the\neconomy of different regions, even, because of the sheer size of the business.\nIt’s a shame, it is really a shame.”\n\nIger’s comments come the day after it was announced that he will remain the CEO\nof Walt Disney Co.\n[https://variety.com/2023/film/news/bob-iger-disney-ceo-extension-2026-1235668668/]\nthrough 2026, instead of stepping down at the end of next year as originally\nplanned.\n\nIn a shocking move, Iger returned as Disney CEO in November 2022, less than a\nyear after his initial exit from a 15-year run at the helm. He took over for Bob\nChapek, with his intention being to look for a new successor. However, with\nDisney’s numerous internal issues and the need to reinvent its linear TV model\nin the streaming age, it was expected within the industry that Iger’s contract\nwould be extended.\n\nIn 2022, Iger’s total pay package was $15 million, though Chapek (who was paid\n$24.5 million) was at the helm for the majority of last year. After Iger took\nover again, it was revealed that he has the potential to earn up to $27 million\n[https://variety.com/2022/film/finance/bob-iger-compensation-package-salary-bob-chapek-fired-1235439151/]\nin 2023, his first full year as returned CEO.\n\nSpeaking of Disney’s linear business, which includes broadcaster ABC as well as\ncablers Disney Channel and FX, among others, Iger said that it “may not be core\nto Disney.” When Faber suggested the idea of a sale, Iger said the company will\nbe “open-minded and objective about the future of those businesses.”\n\n“There clearly is content that they create that is core to Disney, but the\ndistribution model, the business model that forms the underpinning of that\nbusiness — and that is delivering great profits over the years — is definitely\nbroken, and we have to call it like it is,” Iger said. “When I came back, one of\nthe things I discovered was that the disruptive forces that have been preying on\nthat business for a while are greater than I thought. It’s eye-opening. There’s\na reality to it that we have to come to grips with, and we have to come to grips\nwith it now.”\n\nIger also addressed presidential hopeful and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ attacks\non Disney over the company’s opposition to Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill. “The\nnotion that Disney is in any way sexualizing our children quite frankly is\npreposterous and inaccurate,” Iger said.\n\nIn April 2022, DeSantis signed a bill eliminating Disney’s special independent\ndistrict status in Walt Disney World. A few days later, Disney sued DeSantis for\nretaliating against the company’s freedom of speech.\n\nFaber also asked Iger about the Neo-Nazi demonstration that occurred outside of\nWalt Disney World in June. “It was horrifying, quite frankly, and it’s\nconcerning to me that anyone would encourage a level of intolerance or even hate\nthat frankly could even become dangerous action,” Iger said."

The data from the agency’s\nannual report, published in late April, represents “apparent” consumption of\nalcohol because it is inferred from alcohol sales data by state, as opposed to\ntraditional survey data.\n\nThe drinking patterns reported by the NIAAA varied significantly by state. In\nnine states — including Florida, Tennessee and New Jersey — alcohol consumption\nincreased by at least 10 percent.\n\nThe NIAAA data suggests that increased alcohol consumption may be more\npronounced than previously believed. The 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and\nHealth indicated that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults of drinking age reported\ndrinking the same or less than they did before the pandemic.\n\nResearchers say this type of survey data can mask risky behavior or changes in\ndrinking habits because respondents often underreport their alcohol use.\n\nALCOHOL-RELATED DEATHS INCREASED IN EVERY STATE\n\nAs alcohol use was surging, so were alcohol-related deaths. Between 2018 and\n2021, deaths caused by alcohol increased in every state, according to CDC\nmortality data.\n\nSome states that had some of the biggest increases in consumption also had some\nof the largest spikes in alcohol-related death rates. In Mississippi, the rate\nof deaths caused by alcohol more than doubled in a four-year span, rising from 7\ndeaths per 100,000 residents to about 18 deaths per 100,000 in 2021.\n\n“The costs of alcohol abuse and dependence are phenomenal,” said Jefferson\nParker, a professor of psychiatry who co-directs a new addiction treatment\nprogram at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, which last fall\nreceived a $6 million federal grant to help treat alcohol use disorder, along\nwith opioid addiction.\n\nNew Mexico had more than 51 deaths per 100,000 residents, the highest rate of\nalcohol-related deaths in the country, and an increase of almost 50 percent from\nits rate in 2018. Death rates related to alcohol also nearly doubled in Montana,\nSouth Dakota and Delaware during that time.\n\nMany different underlying diseases or conditions involving alcohol could cause\ndeath. Between 2018 and 2021, the rate of Americans dying from alcoholic\ncirrhosis of the liver, the leading alcohol-related cause of death, grew by 42\npercent, while deaths stemming from alcohol dependence or harmful use disorders\nincreased by 54 percent.\n\nYounger drinkers saw the biggest increase in the rate of alcohol-related deaths,\nwhich spiked by nearly 80 percent among 25-to-44-year-olds, a Washington Post\nanalysis of CDC data found. For every 100,000 people that age, 12 people died of\nalcohol-related issues in 2021, the analysis found.\n\nOlder age groups didn’t see rises that dramatic but already had high rates.\nPeople between the ages of 55 and 64 had the highest rate of alcohol-related\ndeaths, at 42 per 100,000.\n\nThose findings add to similarly grim statistics. A CDC study published last fall\nestimated\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2798004?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=110122]\nthat between 2015 and 2019, excessive alcohol use was to blame for 1 in 8 deaths\nof Americans between the ages of 20 and 64.\n\nDRIVEN BY SPIRITS SALES AND LOOSENING OF RULES\n\nThe pandemic spike was notably driven by sales of spirits, which rose nearly 17\npercent compared with less than 1 percent for both wine and beer.\n\nIn Rhode Island, where Logan and Gazerro live in the town of Warwick, the state\nranked third in terms of relative increases in spirits sales since 2018.\n\nFor Gazerro, a podcaster and consultant, his drinking escalated in his 30s and\ngot worse during the boredom of pandemic shutdowns. There was a liquor store a\nfew blocks from his apartment. The pandemic also spurred lawmakers in Rhode\nIsland, among other states, to allow restaurants to sell takeout alcohol. Rhode\nIsland has since made\n[https://www.wpri.com/news/politics/bill-that-would-permanently-allow-to-go-alcohol-sales-heads-to-mckees-desk/]\nthe measure permanent.\n\nThe growth of the spirits industry has been pronounced, helped by the popularity\nof luxury brands and ones backed by celebrities — think tequila brands launched\nby actors such as Dwayne Johnson or Mark Wahlberg. The Distilled Spirits Council\nof the United States reports that in 2022, the spirits revenue market share\n(42.9 percent) eclipsed that of beer (41.9 percent) for the first time. The\ncouncil’s president recently called it a “great American success story,”\naccording to CNBC\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/16/liquor-industry-trends-as-spirits-take-market-share-from-beer.html].\n\nThe council cites changing consumer tastes toward high-end products, plus\nready-to-drink beverages such as hard seltzers, and the proliferation of craft\ndistilleries, which number more than 2,600 today.\n\nDuring the pandemic, consumers who weren’t spending on vacations or restaurants\ninstead spent on luxury spirits they could stock at home, said Amanda Berger,\nthe council’s vice president of science and health.\n\n“The majority of adults who choose to drink do so responsibly, and we have seen\ndecreases in harmful drinking (including binge drinking and underage drinking)\nfor more than a decade,” she said.\n\nWhile the share of Americans under 35 that report binge drinking decreased by\nabout 20 percent between 2011 and 2021, binge drinking has remained at about 18\npercent among 35-to-54-year-olds over the decade and increased by about 13\npercent for those over 55, according to survey data from the CDC’s Behavioral\nRisk Factor Surveillance System.\n\nALCOHOL HAS BECOME MORE AFFORDABLE\n\nCritics have long pointed to the affordability of alcohol as a driving force\nbehind increases in consumption.\n\nCongress last raised the federal alcohol tax in 1991. State taxes vary widely\nbut have generally been stagnant, said Philip J. Cook\n[https://sanford.duke.edu/profile/philip-j-cook/], an economist and professor\nemeritus at Duke University, who has studied alcohol taxes and consumption.\nCongress helped the industry more recently, slashing federal taxes on certain\nalcohol producers in 2017, changes made permanent three years later.\n\n“Alcoholic beverages are cheaper today than they were in the 1980s, relative to\nthe value of the dollar,” Cook said.\n\nPublic health officials say the cost to society is dire.\n\nIn Massachusetts, for example, a Boston University School of Public Health\nreport\n[https://www.bu.edu/sph/files/2022/12/BUSPH_Alcohol-Health-and-Safety-in-Massachusetts.pdf]\nin December found that the state’s excise taxes have lost 72 percent of their\nvalue since 1980, when they were last raised, amounting to less than a nickel\nper drink.\n\n“This is the cheapest and most available drug to American adults,” said David H.\nJernigan, a Boston University professor of health law and a critic of alcohol\nindustry marketing.\n\nIn 2020, Massachusetts state alcohol tax revenue was just $78.6 million,\naccording to the report. Meanwhile, researchers estimated that in 2010, the last\nyear for which data was available, excessive alcohol use cost the state $5.6\nbillion in lost productivity, health care, criminal justice and other areas.\n\nBerger, on the spirits council, disputed the criticism, saying that the spirits\nindustry is one of the country’s most “heavily taxed and regulated industries”\nin the United States and that those who abuse alcohol aren’t deterred by higher\nprices. She said in a statement that tax hikes unfairly raise the cost on\n“responsible consumers” and hurt hospitality businesses still reeling from the\npandemic.\n\nIncreasing taxes remains a tough sell. An effort\n[https://www.wweek.com/news/2023/03/29/the-death-of-a-proposed-beer-and-wine-tax-highlights-vast-differences-in-oregons-taxes-on-intoxicants/#:~:text=Beer%2C%20cider%20and%20wine%20producers,resulting%20in%20an%20indirect%20tax.]\nto increase taxes on beer and wine in Oregon earlier this year fizzled, and last\nmonth, its governor dropped\n[https://www.thechronicleonline.com/news/fee-dropped-50-cent-surcharge-on-alcohol-for-mental-health-services-nixed/article_effcb5dc-0fae-11ee-907a-4b8c4f498b3c.html]\na request to the state’s alcohol commission to impose a 50-cent surcharge on\nbottles of liquor.\n\nIn Massachusetts, liberal Democrats have introduced legislation that would\ndouble the excise tax on alcohol products, which could raise up to an additional\n$89.5 million to be used for substance use education and treatment. But chances\nof the bill passing are not good — Rep. Kay Khan (D) has introduced a similar\nbill for years to no avail.\n\n“It’s sort of a sacred cow,” Khan said. “It’s hard to get people to pay\nattention.”\n\nSOME ARE RETHINKING THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH ALCOHOL\n\nKoob, the director of the NIAAA, is hopeful about the future. He points out that\nmany Americans are nevertheless rethinking their relationship with alcohol, as\nnew research has also punctured the myth that drinking alcohol in moderate\namounts is good for one’s health.\n\nThere’s been a noted decrease in alcohol consumption by underage drinkers, as\nwell as the recognition of dry Januarys and the rising popularity of\nnonalcoholic alternatives, he said.\n\nFor Logan and Gazerro, they’ve been sober for more than a year, although it\nhasn’t been easy. “I loved everything about alcohol. It’s like an old friend I\nhaven’t gotten to hang out with in a while,” Gazerro said.\n\nLogan quit alcohol for her health — and to support her husband. But the cultural\nallure was strong. They felt awkward being out at nightclubs without a drink. So\nthey started the Rhode Island Non-Alcoholic Beer Society, a networking group\n[https://www.facebook.com/groups/rinabs].\n\nSaid Logan, “I wanted people to be able to find restaurants that serve\nnonalcoholic beer, and stores that carried different varieties within the\nstate.”"

        "content": "BANGKOK -- BANGKOK (AP) —\n\nThe leader of the progressive Thai political party that outpaced its rivals to a\nsurprise first-place finish in May’s general election\n[https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/Elections] failed Thursday in his initial bid to\nhave Parliament name him the country’s new prime minister.\n\nThe vote of a joint session of the 500-seat House of Representatives and\n250-seat Senate saw Pita Limjaroenrat win 324 votes in the first round of\nballoting, short of the majority of 376 needed to become prime minister.\n\nHis Move Forward Party finished first in the May 14 election and afterward\nassembled an eight-party coalition that together had won 312 seats, a healthy\nmajority in the lower house.\n\nBut strong opposition in the Senate, whose members are overwhelmingly\nconservative and generally opposed to the reformist platform of Pita’s party,\nseemingly doomed his chances in the first vote. Only 13 senators supported\nPita's bid, while 34 voted against him and 159 abstained.\n\nPita told reporters afterwards that he “accepted” the vote but was not giving\nup. He said the result was below expectations and thanked the senators who voted\nfor him.\n\nThe biggest area of disagreement between the liberals backing Move Forward and\nthe deeply conservative Senate is the campaign pledge of Pita’s party to amend a\nlaw that makes defaming the royal family punishable by three to 15 years in\nprison.\n\nThe monarchy is sacrosanct to members of Thailand’s royalist establishment. Even\nminor reforms that might improve and modernize the monarchy’s image are anathema\nto them. Move Forward’s coalition has proposed to limit the “royal defamation”\nlaw to allow only the royal family to lodge complaints and soften penalties.\n\nMuch of the debate that preceded Thursday’s vote concerned that law, also known\nas Article 112, which critics say is abused for political purposes.\n\nThe inconclusive finish to Thursday's voting sets the stage for another ballot,\nwhich is expected next week. Whether Pita will make a second effort, or step\naside to let a nominee from another party in his coalition try their luck, was\nnot immediately known.\n\nSome opponents explicitly said his party's stand on Article 112 was the reason\nthey would not vote for a government led by Pita. The Pheu Thai Party, the\nsecond biggest in the coalition holding 141 House seats, could step up and try\nto win support from enough senators.\n\nPheu Thai used to be the royalist establishment’s most bitter rival. The party\nis closely affiliated with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a\nbillionaire populist who was ousted in a 2006 military coup, in part because his\npopularity rubbed royalists the wrong way. But the party is anxious to get back\ninto power, and less strident in supporting a reformist agenda that\nconservatives deem radical, though it would be considered moderate in Western\ncountries.\n\nShould Pheu Thai fail to successfully push through a prime minister candidate,\nthe coalition would have to consider taking on new members.\n\nPita, regardless of how the prime minister issue is settled, faces additional\nchallenges.\n\nOn Wednesday, the state Election Commission said it concluded there was evidence\nthat he had violated election law, and referred his case to the Constitutional\nCourt for a ruling. If the court accepts the case and finds him guilty, he could\nlose his House seat, get kicked out of politics and face a prison sentence.\n\nThere had been fears since even before the election that Thailand’s conservative\nruling establishment would use what its political opponents consider to be dirty\ntricks to cling to power. For a decade-and-a-half, it has repeatedly utilized\nthe courts and nominally independent state agencies such as the Election\nCommission to issue controversial rulings to cripple or sink political\nopponents.\n\nThe alleged violation involves undeclared ownership of media company shares,\nwhich are banned for Thai lawmakers. Political scientist Thitinan Pongsudhirak\ndescribed the disputed charge and other legal complaints against Pita as “bogus”\nand something many people, especially voters who backed him, would be unwilling\nto tolerate.\n\nA small number of Move Forward’s supporters, wearing the party’s signature\norange colors, gathered outside Parliament, following the proceedings vote by\nvote on a large screen. They expressed disappointment and anger at the final\nresult, especially the lack of support from senators.\n\n“The Senate are not with the people. The election did not mean anything to\nthem,” complained Nattapon Jangwangkaew, 42.\n\n“I’m not ok with this,\" said 35-year-old Wipada Pimtare, who was crying in the\nrain. \"I hoped that it would finish today. Thailand should move forward. They\nshouldn’t buy time like this. The people have chosen and they should follow.”\n\nPro-democracy activists have already called for protests, and there is concern\nthat they could snowball, especially if Move Forward is shut out of power. When\na forerunner party to Move Forward was forced to dissolve in 2019, it sparked a\nyouth-led protest movement that ended up violently resisting efforts to disperse\ntheir gatherings. Political polarization in the years following the 2006 coup\nagainst Thaksin saw bursts of intense street fighting from both right and left,\non occasion paralysing central areas of the capital Bangkok and its\ninternational airport.\n\nDepending how they are resolved, the efforts to block Pita and Move Forward\ncould prove dangerous and cause Thailand unnecessary pain, said Michael\nMontesano, a Thai studies expert who is an associate senior fellow at\nSingapore’s ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\n“At the end of the day, the political system and those who would dominate need\nto move into closer correspondence with the realities of Thai society and with\nthe aspirations of its younger, well-educated members,” Montesano said. “The\nbiggest question is whether this transition will be painful and even violent, or\nwhether it will be constructive and thus serve the country’s future prospects.”\n\n——-\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Tian Macleod Ji contributed to this report."

The teams will determine if tornadoes hit those areas, and\nif so, will work to pin down their tracks and intensity ratings.\n\nThe weather service said the suspected tornadoes were spawned by rotating\nthunderstorms known as supercells.\n\nMeteorologist Victor Gensini estimated that most of the tornadoes that occurred\nWednesday “were rather short-lived and rather weak.”\n\nMorning rainfall and cloud cover dampened the amount of instability that could\nbuild up in the atmosphere, and the storm system was vertically shorter — and\nless deadly — than a typical tornado, said Gensini, who is a professor of\nmeteorology at Northern Illinois University.\n\n“Sometimes thunderstorms can get so tall and so strong that they reach up to …\n60,000 feet. The storms yesterday were in the 25,000- or 30,000-foot range,” he\nsaid.\n\nA cluster of storms formed in mid-to-late afternoon in northwest Illinois, moved\ntoward the Interstate 39 corridor and eventually into the western suburbs of\nChicago, hitting peak intensity around 5 to 6:30 p.m. central time, Gensini\nsaid.\n\n“I’m sad for the folks that are cleaning up today, and picking up tree limbs,\nbut at least we’re not talking about planning funerals,” he said.\n\nHillary Timpe in Countryside, Illinois, a suburb southwest of Chicago, was with\nher husband, Greg, when the tornado whipped quickly through their neighborhood,\ndamaging homes.

Huntley Battalion Chief Mike Pierce told\n[https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-weather-forecast-flash-flooding-flood-radar/13492647/]\nABC-7-TV that firefighters and other emergency services were responding to\ndowned power lines, trees and tree branches, and that power outages had been\nreported. Building damage appeared to be concentrated around two apartment\nbuildings, he said.\n\nMore than 10,000 customers lost power in the region, but power was mostly\nrestored by Thursday morning, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nIn southern Michigan, a weather service survey team found a tornado with peak\nwinds of 90 mph (145 kph) developed shortly after 11 p.m. over a storage\nfacility near the village of Colon, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of\nKalamazoo. Garage doors were blown in, and roofing materials were carried off to\nfields up to 200 yards (meters) away, the team found. Trees also were damaged.\n\nOver the years many tornadoes have struck in the Chicago metropolitan area, and\nseveral have hit within the city limits of Chicago, according to the National\nWeather Service. Between 1855 and 2021, the weather service recorded 97\nsignificant tornadoes in the Chicago metro area.\n\nThe deadliest formed in Palos Hills in Cook County on April 21, 1967. The\ntwister traveled 16 miles (26 kilometers) through Oak Lawn and the south side of\nChicago, killing 33 people, injuring 500 and causing more than $50 million in\ndamage, according to the weather service.\n\n\n___\n\nCallahan reported from Indianapolis."

Kennedy Jr. has a history of\nrepeatedly sharing unfounded conspiracies that man-made chemicals in the\nenvironment could be making children gay or transgender and causing the\nfeminization of boys and masculinization of girls.\n\nExperts dispute the claims from Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and\nanti-vaccine activist, and told CNN’s KFile his theories that “sexual\nidentification” and “gender confusion” among children could be from their\nexposure to “endocrine disruptors” found in the environment are completely\nunfounded.\n\n“I want to just pursue just one question on these, you know, the other endocrine\ndisruptors because our children now, you know, we’re seeing these impacts that\npeople suspect are very different than in ages past about sexual identification\namong children and sexual confusion, gender confusion,” Kennedy said on his\npodcast in June last year. “These kinds of issues that are very, very\ncontroversial today.”\n\nEndocrine disruptors are chemicals that interfere with the body’s hormones and\nendocrine system, according to\n[https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/overview-endocrine-disruption#examples]the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Such chemicals are commonly found in pesticides\nand plastic, and can affect reproductive functions and increase the risk of\nobesity. Kennedy on multiple occasions misconstrued endocrine disruptors’\nstudied [https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0909519107] ability to cause some male\nfrogs to become female and produce viable eggs, suggesting that these chemicals\ncould have similar effects on children and change their sexuality.\n\nCNN spoke to multiple experts who said there is no link between endocrine\ndisruptors and children’s gender and sexuality. While sex in in frogs is\ndetermined by environmental factors such as temperature and chemicals, Dr.\nAndrea Gore, professor of pharmacology and toxicology at University of Texas at\nAustin, said the sex of humans is determined at the moment of conception, and\ncannot later be altered by endocrine-disrupting chemicals.\n\nThe baseless claim that chemicals – particularly in tap water – could turn\npeople gay has gained popularity\n[https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/03/politics/kfile-ron-desantis-disney-ron-peri-anti-lgbtq/index.html]\nwith conspiracy theorists over the years, most memorably with conservative radio\nhost Alex Jones, who said chemicals in the water were “turning the friggin’\nfrogs gay.”\n\n“Mr. Kennedy’s remarks are being mischaracterized. He is not claiming that\nendocrine disruptors are the only or main cause of gender dysphoria,” a Kennedy\ncampaign spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “He is merely suggesting that,\ngiven copious research on the effects on other vertebrates, this possibility\ndeserves further research.”\n\nCNN’s KFile reviewed dozens of appearances from Kennedy, both on his podcast,\nand in other media in recent years where he occasionally discussed the topic.\nKennedy has been polling around 19% among Democratic voters in his bid to\nchallenge President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.\n\nKennedy made the comments multiple times between March 2022 and June 2023.\n\n“If you expose frogs to atrazine, male frogs, it changes their sex and they can\nactually bear young. They can lay eggs, fertile eggs,” Kennedy said in the June\n2022 episode\n[https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/rfkjr/episodes/Chemical-Attack-On-Children-with-Dr--David-Carpenter-e1k64eo/a-a84shr0]\nof his podcast.\n\n“And so the capacity for these chemicals that we are just raining down on our\nchildren right now to induce these very profound sexual changes in them is\nsomething we need to be thinking about as a society,” he added.\n\nAtrazine, one of the most common herbicides, is an endocrine disruptor, though\nGore said there is no link between these chemicals and gender and sexuality in\nhumans.\n\n“I don’t think people should be making statements about the relationship between\nenvironmental chemicals and changes in sexuality when there’s zero evidence,”\nshe said.\n\nA study [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0909519107] Kennedy discussed on\nmultiple podcast episodes exposed male African clawed frogs to atrazine in a\nlab, castrating 75% of the male frogs and turning one in 10 males into females.\n\nOn an episode of Jordan Peterson’s podcast, a video of which was removed from\nYouTube\n[https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/20/tech/youtube-robert-f-kennedy-jr-video-removed/index.html],\nKennedy said children are “swimming through a soup of toxic chemicals.” He\nfurther discussed how atrazine can “chemically castrate and forcibly feminize”\nfrogs, saying “if it’s doing that to frogs, there’s a lot of other evidence that\nit’s doing it to human beings as well.” Kennedy did not offer any proof of\nsimilar changes happening in human beings.\n\nDr. Linda Kahn, assistant professor in the departments of pediatrics and\npopulation health at New York University, added that comparing frogs to humans\nis an “apples and oranges thing, it’s not appropriate.” For humans, atrazine is\nmetabolized and excreted from the body within 12 hours, she said.\n\nDuring Kennedy’s June appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, he discussed\n[https://open.spotify.com/episode/3DQfcTY4viyXsIXQ89NXvg] atrazine’s effect on\nmale frogs but did not make a direct link between chemical exposure and\nsexuality as in previous comments.\n\n“Nobody knows. Cause we know what it does to frogs,” he said. “But nobody knows\nwhat that does to, what it’s doing, those kinds of persistent exposures would do\nto our children.”\n\nKennedy also said on a 2022 episode of his podcast\n[https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/rfkjr/episodes/Kiss-the-Ground-and-Regenerative-Agriculture-with-John-Roulac-e1fd1um]\nthat the Midwest’s entire water supply is “coated” with atrazine, and boys and\ngirls in these areas have delayed puberty. But later he contradicted himself in\na March [https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Jkoz1htxK7DJ0R1LBTz5h] episode of his\npodcast, when he said endocrine disruptors are causing early menstrual cycles in\ngirls.\n\nKahn said while general studies on endocrine disruptors have shown effects on\npuberty, no study has proven if atrazine, the chemical Kennedy often cites,\nspecifically affects puberty in humans.\n\nGore added that, while general studies on endocrine disruptors have shown a\ntrend in early onset puberty and a decreased sperm count in men, these effects\nare part of a multitude of factors affecting children’s development. Endocrine\ndisruptors’ effects on puberty and reproduction functions are not linked to\nsexuality and gender expression in children.\n\nWhile Kennedy’s claims that chemicals are causing sexual dysphoria in children\nare false, Gore said there is legitimate concern over endocrine disruptors’\nproven effect on diabetes, obesity, thyroid disease and more.\n\nBut both Gore and Kahn said that routine exposure to endocrine disruptors is\njust one factor that can affect a person’s risk for disease.\n\n“It’s not as dramatic on an individual level as it might, he might be making it\nout to be,” Kahn said."

Lawmaker Gurulyov\nis a hardline former army commander who regularly appears on state television.\n\nIt was unclear when the message was recorded and Popov's current whereabouts\nwere not known. The defence ministry has not said anything about his dismissal.\n\nSuch public criticism of Russia's military leadership from a battle-hardened\ngeneral less than three weeks since the Wagner mutiny, if authentic, would\nindicate continued discontent within the Russian army as it fights the biggest\nland war in Europe since World War Two.\n\n\nRUSSIAN ARMY\n\nPutin, Russia's paramount leader since 1999, has said the mutiny risked tipping\nRussia into civil war and has compared it to the revolutionary turmoil of 1917.\n\nThe Kremlin has sought to project calm, but Russian officials and diplomats have\ntold Reuters that the full consequences of the mutiny - which Wagner leader\nYevgeny Prigozhin said was aimed only at settling scores with Shoigu and\nGerasimov - have yet to play out.\n\nNeither Prigozhin nor General Sergei Surovikin, a deputy commander of Russia's\nmilitary operations in Ukraine, have been seen in public since the day of the\nmutiny.\n\n[1/2]Major General Ivan Popov, who commanded Russia's 58th Combined Arms Army,\nis seen in this image released on June 9, 2023.

The subject is the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, the\nclosest star-forming region to Earth. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Klaus Pon\nvia AP\n\nThe Webb Space Telescope is marking one year of cosmic photographs with one of\nits best yet: the dramatic close-up of dozens of stars at the moment of birth.\n\nNASA unveiled the latest snapshot Wednesday, revealing 50 baby stars in a cloud\ncomplex 390 light-years away. A light-year is nearly 6 trillion miles (9.7\ntrillion kilometers).\n\nThe region is relatively small and quiet yet full of illuminated gases, jets of\nhydrogen and even dense cocoons of dust with the delicate beginnings of even\nmore stars.\n\nAll of the young stars [https://phys.org/tags/young+stars/] appear to be no\nbigger than our sun. Scientists said the breathtaking shot provides the best\nclarity yet of this brief phase of a star's life.\n\n\"It's like a glimpse of what our own system would have looked like billions of\nyears ago when it was forming,\" NASA program scientist Eric Smith told The\nAssociated Press.\n\nSmith pointed out that the starlight visible in the image actually left there\n390 years ago. On Earth in 1633, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei went on\ntrial in Rome for saying that the Earth revolved around the sun. The Vatican in\n1992 acknowledged Galileo was wronged.\n\nThis cloud complex, known as Rho Ophiuchi, is the closest star-forming region to\nEarth and is found in the sky near the border of the constellations Ophiuchus\nand Scorpius, the serpent-bearer and scorpion. With no stars in the foreground\nof the photo, NASA noted, the details stand out all the more. Some of the stars\ndisplay shadows indicating possible planets in the making, according to NASA.\n\n\n\nIt \"presents star birth as an impressionistic masterpiece,\" NASA Administrator\nBill Nelson said in a tweet.\n\nWebb—the largest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever launched into\nspace—has been churning out cosmic beauty shots for the past year. The first\npictures from the $10 billion infrared telescope were unveiled last July, six\nmonths after its liftoff from French Guiana.\n\nIt's considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, orbiting Earth for\n33 years. A joint NASA-European Space Agency effort, Webb scans the universe\nfrom a more distant perch, 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away.\n\nStill ahead for Webb: Astronomers hope to behold the earliest stars and galaxies\nof the universe while scouring the cosmos for any hints of life on planets\noutside our solar system.\n\n\"We haven't found one of them yet,\" Smith said. \"But we're still only one year\ninto the mission.\"\n\n© 2023 The Associated Press.

The Americans — who were missing almost all of their\nEuropean-based stars for this tournament — looked gassed, especially early on.\nThe hosts found their feet in the second half, but even then they rode their\nluck. Turner — one of just two regular starters when the U.S. is at full\nstrength on interim coach B.J. Callaghan's Gold Cup roster — made an all-world\nstop in the second half to keep his side in it:\n\nThere was still a sense all night long that this one might be beyond the U.S.\nAnd even though Ferreira nearly saved his team with his ruthlessly taken\nequalizer, the spent Americans simply couldn't muster enough magic to win a\nsecond penalty shootout in 72 hours.\n\n\"We're not a group that's going to make excuses,\" Callaghan said afterward. \"I\ndon't have anything but positive things to say how the group handled this\nmatch.\"\n\nPanama was even better than advertised\n\nWhen the U.S. got paired with Canada in the quarterfinals, Callaghan said the\nAmericans were relishing the chance to go up against an opponent that, like\nthem, competed at last year's World Cup.\n\nAdd in the growing dislike between the two North American neighbors, and the\nmatch more than lived up to the hype. The Canadians gave the U.S. all they could\nhandle before the U.S. staved off defeat by equalizing in the second half of\nextra time and then advancing thanks to Turner's heroics in the penalty\nshootout.\n\nSurely Los Canaleros, which the U.S. had a 17-2-6 record against all-time coming\ninto Wednesday's contest, wouldn't provide a sterner test than that. Yet they\ndid, with Panama bossing the tired USMNT\n[https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/usmnt-will-be-fighting-fatigue-in-gold-cup-semifinal-vs-panama]\nfor most of the contest.\n\nIt turned it into a landmark victory.\n\n\"We knew that it was going to be almost impossible to win against the United\nStates [https://www.foxsports.com/soccer/united-states-men-team],\" Panama coach\nThomas Christiansen said afterward, noting that the U.S. was playing on home\nsoil in front of its own supporters . \"Today was the moment to take advantage\nof, to get to the final, which is the dream of all Panamanians.\" \n\nA cruel end for Ferreira, Turner and the rest of the USMNT\n\nThe U.S. knew full well how dangerous a foe Panama could be, but it's still a\nshocking result. After making 12 of the last 16 Gold Cup deciders and winning\nnot just the 2021 title but also consecutive Nations League titles over the last\ntwo years, the U.S. expects to not just reach every regional finale, but to\nprevail.\n\nThat's not to suggest that this Gold Cup was a wasted exercise for the program.\nJames Sands [https://www.foxsports.com/soccer/james-sands-player] proved that he\ncan excel as a defensive midfielder; he may even have done enough to leapfrog\nKellyn Acosta [https://www.foxsports.com/soccer/kellyn-acosta-player] as 2022\nWorld Cup captain Tyler Adams'\n[https://www.foxsports.com/soccer/tyler-adams-2-player] understudy.\n\nFerreira was cold-blooded all tournament. His seven-goal tally tied Clint\nDempsey's 2015 record for most goals scored by an American at the Gold Cup, and\nhis timely goal on Wednesday should end any talk that he can't score when it\nreally matters. That he missed his penalty attempt is particularly unfair;\nclearly hobbled after back-to-back 120 minute efforts, Ferreira probably\nwouldn't have been on the field if the U.S. had an available substitute. He\nstill stepped up to take the first kick.\n\n\"Jesus, his play speaks for itself,\" Callaghan said of the 22-year-old. \"He's so\nselfless, he'll do any role that you ask him [to] and I thought that was on\ndisplay.\n\n\"What you see tonight is exactly who he is as a person and a player,\" he added.\n\"I only expect him to get better and have an even bigger impact.\"\n\nBetween the Gold Cup and Nations League, Turner got seven games in a month and\nfurther cemented his status as the national team's No. 1 in net despite his\nerror in extra time.\n\n\nPANAMA'S IVAN ANDERSON SCORES THE FIRST GOAL IN EXTRA TIME\n\nPanama's Ivan Anderson scores the first goal in extra time\n[https://a57.foxsports.com/static-media.fox.com/ms/stg1/sports/1600/900/play-6830afaa0001282--snap_1689213254583.jpeg?ve=1&tl=1]https://www.foxsports.com/watch/play-6830afaa0001282\n\nOther players boosted their stock, too.\n\n\"We wanted to win a second trophy [this summer] so we're disappointed that we\nweren't able to achieve that. We also had other objectives,\" said Callaghan, who\nwill now step aside as 2022 World Cup coach Gregg Berhalter returns to the\nsideline in September. \"We had moments of adversity and saw the group respond to\nit, and I think there's a lot of learning lessons that we're all going to take\naway.\"\n\nDoug McIntyre is a soccer writer for FOX Sports.

        "content": "A retired cosmological theory should be given a second chance at explaining\nanomalies in our Universe, according to theoretical physicist Rajendra Gupta\nfrom the University of Ottawa in Canada.\n\nBy marrying the existing expanding Universe theory with a fringe explanation\n[https://www.science.org/content/article/tired-light-hypothesis-gets-re-tired]\ncalled the tired light hypothesis\n[https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/t/Tired+Light], Gupta has found the Big\nBang [https://www.sciencealert.com/big-bang] could have taken place an\nastonishing 26.7 billion years ago. That's twice as old as current models\npredict.\n\nThose added years could explain why the most distant galaxies observed\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/jwst-captures-details-of-the-four-most-distant-galaxies-ever-seen]\nlook surprisingly mature\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/astronomers-detect-6-massive-galaxies-so-old-they-cant-be-explained-by-science]\nfor star-cities that ought to have only been around for half a billion years.\n\nEstimating the age of the Universe isn't unlike guessing a child's birthday\nbased on their height. Objects in the distance – in every direction – look a\nlittle redder than their signature patterns of light might have us expect. The\nmost likely explanation is that space expands, stretching those light waves\napart like a pulled spring.\n\nAs light takes time to travel, redder light is older light, having been pulled\nover a greater distance. Working backward on this estimated growth rate, it's\npossible to use expansion to determine when the Universe was a compact volume\nseething with concentrated energy.\n\nHowever, this hasn't been the only attempt to explain why light in the distance\nlooks redder. In 1929, Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Zwicky] suggested light simply lost its\npuff over such vast stretches of space. Less energy means lower frequency and\nlonger wavelengths, shifting the spectrum of bright, distant objects.\n\nBasically, the light got 'tired'.\n\nWhile Zwicky would later land upon a landmark discovery\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/warped-starlight-could-be-the-signpost-that-points-to-dark-matter-in-the-milky-way]\nestablishing the great mystery of dark matter\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/dark-matter], his tired light\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired_light] hypothesis suffered too many\nproblems [https://astro.ucla.edu/~wright/tiredlit.htm] to make the grade,\nleaving the expanding Universe model as the theory of choice.\n\nAs Gupta puts it in his recently published proposal\n[https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stad2032/7221343],\nthat doesn't mean the two concepts are mutually exclusive. A combination might\neven help resolve why the earliest quasars and galaxies appear to be billions of\nyears old.\n\nIt might also help explain why they look smaller than expected despite their\nwell-developed masses.\n\nGupta's hybrid hypothesis presumes the Universe really is as big as we believe,\nhaving expanded to its size from a Big Bang event in the past. He starts with\ntwo expanding Universe models: one based on standard assumptions about the\nevenness and flatness of the cosmos and a second one that introduces some tweaks\ninvolving what's known as a coupling constant\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_constant].\n\nCoupling constants describe interactions of forces between particles, such as\nthe way the electromagnetic fields of two protons held in close proximity will\naffect each other's behavior in specific ways.\n\nAll forces have a coupling constant, which isn't necessarily constant at all,\nchanging with energy. This leaves room for coupling constants to vary enough to\naffect how light behaves. If this constant has changed over time, our\ncalculations on the age of the Universe could be out by a significant amount.\n\n\"Our newly-devised model stretches the galaxy formation time by several billion\nyears, making the universe 26.7 billion years old, and not 13.7 as previously\nestimated,\" says\n[https://www.uottawa.ca/about-us/media/news/reinventing-cosmology-uottawa-research-puts-age-universe-267-137-billion-years]\nGupta.\n\nOne of the problems with tired light theory is that a loss of energy in a light\nwave would correspond with a loss of momentum, affecting the appearance of far\ndistant objects. With ancient galaxies looking unusually petite, this conflict\nmight actually be a reason to reconsider the hypothesis.\n\nAs happens whenever observations don't quite align with expectations, scientists\nthrow every idea they can think of at the problem to see what sticks. Some are\nmundane, some quirky, and some dig up the corpses of dead hypotheses to see if\nthey have heartbeats after all.\n\nWhatever explanation is left standing in the end, it will almost certainly\nchange how we look at our Universe, and its dazzling contents, evolve.\n\nThis research was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical\nSociety\n[https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stad2032/7221343]."

Blige,\nEminem, Kendrick Lamar, 50 Cent became the first Super Bowl halftime show to win\na top program Emmy.\n\nThese are the first Primetime Emmy nominations for Rihanna\n[https://www.billboard.com/artist/rihanna/] and Elton John\n[https://www.billboard.com/artist/elton-john/]. If the British superstar wins,\nhe’ll become an EGOT. Chris Rock [https://www.billboard.com/artist/chris-rock/]\nis a four-time Primetime Emmy winner, including a 1997 award for outstanding\nvariety, music or comedy special for Chris Rock: Bring the Pain.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live! (ABC) received its 12th nomination for outstanding talk\nseries, which puts it in a tie with Real Time With Bill Maher for the most nods\nin the category without a win (yet). Competing with Kimmel’s show this year are\nThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert (CBS, its seventh nod in the category), The\nDaily Show With Trevor Noah (Comedy Central, its sixth), Late Night with Seth\nMeyers (NBC, its second) and The Problem With Jon Stewart (Apple TV+, its\nfirst).\n\nLast Week Tonight With John Oliver, which won for outstanding talk series the\nlast seven years in a row, was moved to outstanding scripted variety series,\nwhere it is nominated. Its chief competition in its new category is Saturday\nNight Live, which has won here the last six years in a row. The Emmys\n[https://www.billboard.com/t/emmys/] have thus shaken up two categories where\nthere was very little suspense. The scripted variety series category is rounded\nout by HBO’s A Black Lady Sketch Show, nominated for the fourth year in a row.\n\nNBC’s The Voice is nominated for outstanding reality/competition program for the\n12th time, which constitutes a new record for a music or dance program. It tops\nDancing With the Stars (11 nods), American Idol (nine) and So You Think You Can\nDance (five).\n\nDear Mama (FX), a program about Tupac Shakur\n[https://www.billboard.com/artist/tupac-shakur/] and his mother, Afeni Shakur,\nis competing for outstanding documentary or non-fiction series. Another series\nabout a rapper, jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy, about Ye, formerly known as Kanye\nWest, was nominated last year, but lost to The Beatles: Get Back.\n\nGeorge & Tammy (Showtime), about country music legends George Jones\n[https://www.billboard.com/artist/george-jones/] and Tammy Wyne\n[https://www.billboard.com/artist/tammy-wynette/]tte, is nominated for\noutstanding limited or anthology series.\n\nWeird: The Al Yankovic Story (The Roku Channel) and Dolly Parton’s Mountain\nMagic Christmas (NBC) are nominated for outstanding television movie. Dolly\nParton’s Christmas on the Square won in this category two years ago. Other\nrecent music-related movies to win in this category are Bessie (about gospel\nlegend Bessie Smith, 2015) and Behind the Candelabra (about entertainer\nLiberace, 2013).\n\nCarol Burnett: 90 Years Of Laughter + Love is nominated for outstanding variety\nspecial (pre-recorded). This is the seventh consecutive decade the TV icon has\nreceived a nomination. She landed her first nod in 1962 for her work on The\nGarry Moore Show.\n\nThe 75th Emmy Awards are set to telecast live coast-to-coast from Los Angeles on\nMonday, Sept. 18, (8:00-11:00 p.m. ET/5:00-8:00 p.m. PT) on FOX. Emmy winners\nJesse Collins and Dionne Harmon and Emmy nominee Jeannae Rouzan-Clay of Jesse\nCollins Entertainment will executive produce the show.\n\nHere are the nominees in all program categories.\n\n\nOUTSTANDING VARIETY SPECIAL (LIVE)\n\nThe Apple Music Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show Starring Rihanna • FOX • Jesse\nCollins Entertainment, DPS and Roc Nation\n\nChris Rock: Selective Outrage • Netflix • Netflix / Tenth Planet\n\nElton John Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium • Disney+ • Disney+ Presents in\nassociation with Rocket Entertainment / A Fulwell 73 Production\n\nThe Oscars • ABC • Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\n\n75th Annual Tony Awards • CBS • White Cherry Entertainment\n\n\nOUTSTANDING VARIETY SPECIAL (PRE-RECORDED)\n\nCarol Burnett: 90 Years Of Laughter + Love • NBC • Silent House Productions\n\nJohn Mulaney: Baby J • Netflix • Netflix\n\nLizzo: Live In Concert • HBO Max • HBO Max in association with LizzoBangers and\nDone+Dusted\n\nNorman Lear: 100 Years Of Music & Laughter • ABC • Done+Dusted\n\nTrevor Noah: I Wish You Would • Netflix • Bob Bain Productions, Day Zero\nProductions and Mainstay Entertainment for Netflix\n\nWanda Sykes: I’m An Entertainer • Netflix • Push It Productions for Netflix\n\n\nOUTSTANDING TALK SERIES\n\nThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah • Comedy Central • Central Productions, LLC\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live! • ABC • ABC Signature in association with Kimmelot\n\nLate Night With Seth Meyers • NBC • Universal Television and Broadway Video\n\nThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert • CBS • CBS Studios\n\nThe Problem With Jon Stewart • Apple TV+ • Busboy / EDEN in association with\nApple\n\n\nOUTSTANDING SCRIPTED VARIETY SERIES\n\nA Black Lady Sketch Show • HBO Max • HBO in association with For Better or\nWords, Inc., HooRAE, 3 Arts Entertainment and Jax Media\n\nLast Week Tonight With John Oliver • HBO Max • HBO in association with Sixteen\nString Jack Productions and Avalon Television\n\nSaturday Night Live • NBC • SNL Studios in association with Universal Television\nand Broadway Video\n\n\nOUTSTANDING REALITY COMPETITION PROGRAM\n\nThe Amazing Race • CBS • WorldRace Productions, Inc.\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race • MTV • World of Wonder\n\nSurvivor • CBS • MGM Television\n\nTop Chef • Bravo • Magical Elves\n\nThe Voice • NBC • MGM Television and Warner Bros.

They're also widespread in the Universe, so they can't be taken as a clear\nsignature of the presence of life. That creates an annoying situation regarding\nthe search for evidence of life on Mars, which clearly has some organic\nchemicals despite the harsh environment.\n\nBut we don't know whether these are the right kinds of molecules to be\nindications of life. For the moment, we also lack the ability to tear apart\nMartian rocks, isolate the molecules, and figure out exactly what they are. In\nthe meantime, our best option is to get some rough information on them and\nfigure out the context of where they're found on Mars. And a big step has been\nmade in that direction with the publication of results from imaging done by the\nPerseverance rover.\n\n\nASK SHERLOC\n\nThe instrument that's key to the new work has a name that pretty much tells you\nit was designed to handle this specific question: Scanning Habitable\nEnvironments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals\n[https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/sherloc/] (SHERLOC).\nSHERLOC comes with a deep-UV laser to excite molecules into fluorescing, and the\nwavelengths they fluoresce at can tell us something about the molecules present.\nIt also has the hardware to do Raman spectroscopy\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy] simultaneously.\n\nCollectively, these two capabilities indicate what kinds of molecules are\npresent, though they can't typically identify specific chemicals. And,\ncritically, SHERLOC provides spatial information, telling us where\nsample-specific signals come from. This allows the instrument to determine which\nchemicals are located in the same spot in a rock and thus were likely formed or\ndeposited together.\n\nSHERLOC can sample rocks simply by being held near them. The new results are\nbased on a set of samples from two rock formations found on the floor of the\nJezero crater. In some cases, the imaging was done by pointing it directly at a\nrock; in others, the rock surface, and any dust and contaminants it contained,\nwas abraded away by Perseverance before the imaging was done.\n\nSHERLOC identified a variety of signatures of potential organic material in\nthese samples. There were a few cases where it was technically possible that the\nsignatures were produced by a very specific chemical that lacked carbon\n(primarily cerium salts). But, given the choice between a huge range of organic\nmolecules or a very specific salt, the researchers favor organic materials as\nthe source.\n\nOne thing that was clear was that the level of organic material present changed\nover time. The deeper, older layer called Séítah only had a tenth of the\nmaterial found in the Máaz rocks that formed above them. The reason for this\ndifference isn't clear, but it indicates that either the production or\ndeposition of organic material on Mars has changed over time.\n\n\nREGIONAL DIFFERENCES\n\nBetween the different samples and the ability to resolve different regions of\nthe samples, the researchers were able to identify distinct signals that each\noccurred in many samples. While it wasn't possible to identify the specific\nmolecule responsible, they were able to say a fair bit about them.\n\nOne signal came from samples that contained a ringed organic compound, along\nwith sulfates. The most common signal came from a two-ringed organic molecule\nand was associated with various salts: phosphate, sulfate, silicates, and\npotentially a perchlorate. Another likely contained a benzene ring associated\nwith iron oxides. A different ringed compound was found in two of the samples.\n\nOverall, the researchers conclude that these differences are significant. The\nfact that distinct organic chemicals are consistently associated with different\nsalts suggests that there were either several distinct ways of synthesizing the\norganics or that they were deposited and preserved under distinct conditions.\nMany of the salts seen here are also associated with either water-based\ndeposition or water-driven chemical alteration of the rock—again, consistent\nwith the processes involved changing over time.\n\nCollectively, the researchers say this argues against the organic chemicals\nsimply having been delivered to Mars on a meteorite.\n\nAgain, the instrument can't tell us what the chemicals are, so there's no way to\nknow whether any of the processes involved in creating these deposits involved\nliving things. But that could eventually change since some of the rocks that\nSHERLOC examined have been used to obtain material for the planned Mars sample\nreturn. If that mission ever happens\n[https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/06/the-mars-sample-return-mission-is-starting-to-give-nasa-sticker-shock/],\nthen we'll finally have the chance to isolate and study the chemicals on Earth.\n\nNature, 2023.  DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-06143-z\n[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06143-z] (\n[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06143-z]About DOIs\n[http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1.ars]).\n[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06143-z]"

Fox Talks The Interrogation Room, Iconic Roles, & Where She'd Hide A\nBody\n\n * Off\n * English\n\nFor those who don’t know, melanoma is a type of skin cancer\n[https://www.theroot.com/kelis-explains-how-husband-mike-moras-death-impacted-he-1850243478].\nAlthough it’s less common than other types of skin cancers, it’s also more\naggressive.\n\nThe recent study tracked over 200,000 cases of male patients diagnosed with\ncutaneous invasive melanoma from 2004 to 2018. Although white men are more\nlikely to be diagnosed with melanoma, the study found that the five-year\nsurvival rate for Black men hovered at 51.7 percent, which was lower than any\nother racial group. On the flip side, the survival rate for white men was around\n75.1 percent.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that, in general, men have a higher rate of death\nfrom melanoma. The reasons for these disparities are debated\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/04/16/skin-cancer-men-melanoma-prevention/].\nSome experts suggest it has something to do with estrogen or other hormonal\nvariables. Another potential explanation is that studies have shown that men\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/04/16/skin-cancer-men-melanoma-prevention/]\nare less likely to use sunscreen than women. Men are also less likely to seek\nmedical care.\n\nThe underlying reasons for the racial disparities in mortality are also still an\nopen question. Access to health care could be a factor here.

Cuprates are the only unconventional superconducting family that\nhost bulk superconductivity with Tcs above the liquid nitrogen boiling\ntemperature at 77 K. Here we observe signatures of superconductivity in single\ncrystals of La3Ni2O7 with a maximum Tc of 80 K at pressures between\n\\(14.0-43.5\\) GPa from high-pressure resistance and mutual inductive magnetic\nsusceptibility measurements. The superconducting phase under high pressure\nexhibits an orthorhombic structure of Fmmm space group with the\n3\\({d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}}\\) and 3\\({d}_{{z}^{2}}\\) orbitals of Ni cations\nstrongly mixing with oxygen 2p orbitals. Our density functional theory\ncalculations suggest the superconductivity emerges coincidently with the\nmetallization of the σ-bonding bands under the Fermi level, consisting of the\n3\\({d}_{{z}^{2}}\\) orbitals with the apical oxygens connecting Ni-O bilayers.\nThus, our discoveries not only reveal important clues for the high-Tc\nsuperconductivity in this Ruddlesden-Popper double-layered perovskite nickelates\nbut also provide a new family of compounds to investigate the high-Tc\nsuperconductivity mechanism.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\n[https://wayf.springernature.com/?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06408-7]\n\n\nACCESS OPTIONS\n\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n\n$29.99 / 30 days\n\ncancel any time\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\nReceive 51 print issues and online access\n\n$199.00 per year\n\nonly $3.90 per issue\n\nRent or buy this article\n\nPrices vary by article type\n\nfrom$1.95\n\nto$39.95\n\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\n\n\nADDITIONAL ACCESS OPTIONS:\n\n * Log in\n   [https://idp.nature.com/authorize/natureuser?client_id=grover&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06408-7]\n * Learn about institutional subscriptions\n   [https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/license-options]\n * Read our FAQs [https://support.nature.com/en/support/home]\n * Contact customer support [https://www.springernature.com/gp/contact]\n\n\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\n\nAuthor notes\n\n 1.

NASA [http://jwst.nasa.gov/multimedia.html]\n\nExisting telescopes can detect exoplanets as small as Earth. However, it takes a\nlot more sensitivity to begin to learn about the chemical composition of these\nplanets.

To bypass this bottleneck, a few of us came\nup with the idea of revisiting an old technology called diffractive lenses.\n\nA cross section of two lenses, with the one on the left showing a jagged surface\nand the one on the right a rounded surface.\n[https://images.theconversation.com/files/536361/original/file-20230707-29-i85svw.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=237&fit=clip]\n\nhttps://images.theconversation.com/files/536361/original/file-20230707-29-i85svw.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip\nDiffractive lenses, left, are much thinner compared to similarly powerful\nrefractive lenses, right. Pko/Wikimedia Commons\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens#/media/File:Fresnel_lens.svg]\n\nConventional lenses use refraction to focus light. Refraction is when light\nchanges direction\n[https://theconversation.com/can-rainbows-form-in-a-circle-fun-facts-on-the-physics-of-rainbows-202952]\nas it passes from one medium to another – it is the reason light bends when it\nenters water. In contrast, diffraction is when light bends around corners and\nobstacles. A cleverly arranged pattern of steps and angles on a glass surface\ncan form a diffractive lens.\n\nThe first such lenses were invented by the French scientist Augustin-Jean\nFresnel in 1819 to provide lightweight lenses for lighthouses\n[https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393350890]. Today, similar diffractive lenses\ncan be found in many small-sized consumer optics – from camera lenses\n[https://global.canon/en/v-square/34.html] to virtual reality headsets\n[https://doi.org/10.1889/1.2206112].\n\nThin, simple diffractive lenses are notorious for their blurry images\n[http://cplire.ru:8080/2902/1/OGRW_2014_Proceedings.pdf#page=77], so they have\nnever been used in astronomical observatories. But if you could improve their\nclarity, using diffractive lenses instead of mirrors or refractive lenses would\nallow a space telescope to be much cheaper, lighter and larger.\n\nA person holding a round, thin piece of glass.\n[https://images.theconversation.com/files/536359/original/file-20230707-17-kdihhg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip]\n\nhttps://images.theconversation.com/files/536359/original/file-20230707-17-kdihhg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip\nOne of the benefits of diffractive lenses is that they can remain thin while\nincreasing in diameter.

Lucky for me, Thomas Milster\n[https://profiles.arizona.edu/person/milster] – one of the world’s leading\nexperts on diffractive lens design – works in the building next to mine. We\nformed a team and got to work.\n\nOver the following two years, our team invented a new type of diffractive lens\nthat required new manufacturing technologies to etch a complex pattern of tiny\ngrooves onto a piece of clear glass or plastic. The specific pattern and shape\nof the cuts focuses incoming light to a single point behind the lens. The new\ndesign produces a near-perfect quality image\n[https://doi.org/10.1364/OSAC.410187], far better than previous diffractive\nlenses.\n\nA triangular piece of glass with subtle etchings reflecting in the light.\n[https://images.theconversation.com/files/536358/original/file-20230707-25-gj9ryc.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip]\n\nhttps://images.theconversation.com/files/536358/original/file-20230707-25-gj9ryc.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip\nA diffractive lens bends light using etchings and patterns on its surface.\nDaniel Apai/University of Arizona, CC BY-ND\n[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/]\n\nBecause it is the surface texture of the lens that does the focusing, not the\nthickness, you can easily make the lens bigger while keeping it very thin and\nlightweight [https://doi.org/10.1364/FIO.2020.JTu7A.1]. Bigger lenses collect\nmore light, and low weight means cheaper launches to orbit\n[https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ab2631] – both great traits for a space\ntelescope.\n\nIn August 2018, our team produced the first prototype, a 2-inch (5-centimeter)\ndiameter lens. Over the next five years, we further improved the image quality\nand increased the size. We are now completing a 10-inch (24-cm) diameter lens\nthat will be more than 10 times lighter than a conventional refractive lens\nwould be.\n\n\nPOWER OF A DIFFRACTION SPACE TELESCOPE\n\nThis new lens design makes it possible to rethink how a space telescope might be\nbuilt. In 2019, our team published a concept called the Nautilus Space\nObservatory [https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ab2631].\n\nUsing the new technology, our team thinks it is possible to build a 29.5-foot\n(8.5-meter) diameter lens that would be only about 0.2 inches (0.5 cm) thick.\nThe lens and support structure of our new telescope could weigh around 1,100\npounds (500 kilograms). This is more than three times lighter than a Webb–style\nmirror of a similar size and would be bigger than Webb’s 21-foot (6.5-meter)\ndiameter mirror.\n\nA spherical object in space with a lens on one side.\n[https://images.theconversation.com/files/536353/original/file-20230707-21-pbljxz.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip]\n\nhttps://images.theconversation.com/files/536353/original/file-20230707-21-pbljxz.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip\nThe thin lens allowed the team to design a lighter, cheaper telescope, which\nthey named the Nautilus Space Observatory. Daniel Apai/University of Arizona, CC\nBY-ND [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/]\n\nThe lenses have other benefits, too. First, they are much easier and quicker\n[https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2633573] to fabricate than mirrors\n[https://theconversation.com/how-do-you-build-a-mirror-for-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-telescopes-49927]\nand can be made en masse. Second, lens-based telescopes work well even when not\naligned perfectly, making these telescopes easier to assemble\n[https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2633760] and fly in space than mirror-based\ntelescopes, which require extremely precise alignment.\n\nFinally, since a single Nautilus unit would be light and relatively cheap to\nproduce, it would be possible to put dozens of them into orbit. Our current\ndesign is in fact not a single telescope, but a constellation of 35 individual\ntelescope units.\n\nEach individual telescope would be an independent, highly sensitive observatory\nable to collect more light than Webb. But the real power of Nautilus would come\nfrom turning all the individual telescopes toward a single target.\n\nBy combining data from all the units, Nautilus’ light-collecting power would\nequal a telescope nearly 10 times larger than Webb. With this powerful\ntelescope, astronomers could search hundreds of exoplanets for atmospheric gases\nthat may indicate extraterrestrial life\n[https://theconversation.com/to-search-for-alien-life-astronomers-will-look-for-clues-in-the-atmospheres-of-distant-planets-and-the-james-webb-space-telescope-just-proved-its-possible-to-do-so-184828].\n\nAlthough the Nautilus Space Observatory is still a long way from launch, our\nteam has made a lot of progress. We have shown that all aspects of the\ntechnology work in small-scale prototypes and are now focusing on building a\n3.3-foot (1-meter) diameter lens. Our next steps are to send a small version of\nthe telescope to the edge of space on a high-altitude balloon.\n\nWith that, we will be ready to propose a revolutionary new space telescope to\nNASA and, hopefully, be on the way to exploring hundreds of worlds for\nsignatures of life."

If\nthe systems that scientists study could be completely isolated from the outside\nworld, things would be a lot easier.\n\nTake quantum computing. It's a field that's already drawing billions of dollars\nin support from tech investors and industry heavyweights including IBM, Google\nand Microsoft. But if the tiniest vibrations creep in from the outside world,\nthey can cause a quantum system [https://phys.org/tags/quantum+system/] to lose\ninformation.\n\nFor instance, even light can cause information leaks if it has enough energy to\njiggle the atoms within a quantum processor chip.\n\n\"Everyone is really excited about building quantum computers to answer really\nhard and important questions,\" said Joe Kitzman, a doctoral student at Michigan\nState University. \"But vibrational excitations can really mess up a quantum\nprocessor.\"\n\nBut, with new research published in the journal Nature Communications, Kitzman\nand his colleagues are showing that these vibrations need not be a hindrance. In\nfact, they could benefit quantum technology.\n\n\"If we can understand how the vibrations couple with our system, we can use that\nas a resource and a tool for creating and stabilizing some types of quantum\nstates,\" Kitzman said.\n\nWhat that means is that researchers can use these results to help mitigate\ninformation lost by quantum bits [https://phys.org/tags/quantum+bits/], or\nqubits (pronounced \"q bits\").\n\nConventional computers rely on a clear-cut binary logic. Bits encode information\nby taking on one of two distinct possible states, often denoted as zero or one.\nQubits, however, are more flexible and can exist in states that are\nsimultaneously both zero and one.\n\nAlthough that may sound like cheating, it's well within the rules of quantum\nmechanics. Still, this feature should give quantum computers valuable advantages\nover conventional computers for certain problems in a variety of areas,\nincluding science, finance and cybersecurity.\n\nBeyond its implications for quantum technology, the MSU-led team's report also\nhelps set the stage for future experiments to better explore quantum systems\n[https://phys.org/tags/quantum+systems/] in general.\n\n\"Ideally, you want to separate your system from the environment, but the\nenvironment is always there,\" said Johannes Pollanen, the Jerry Cowen Endowed\nChair of Physics in the MSU Department of Physics and Astronomy. \"It's almost\nlike junk you don't want to deal with, but you can learn all kinds of cool stuff\nabout the quantum world when you do.\"\n\nPollanen also leads the Laboratory for Hybrid Quantum Systems, of which Kitzman\nis a member, in the College of Natural Science. For the experiments led by\nPollanen and Kitzman, the team built a system consisting of a superconducting\nqubit and what are known as surface acoustic wave resonators.\n\nThese qubits are one of the most popular varieties among companies developing\nquantum computers. Mechanical resonators are used in many modern communications\ndevices, including cellphones and garage door openers, and now, groups like\nPollanen's are putting them to work in emerging quantum technology\n[https://phys.org/tags/quantum+technology/].\n\nThe team's resonators allowed the researchers to tune the vibrations experienced\nby qubits and understand how the mechanical interaction between the two\ninfluenced the fidelity of quantum information.\n\n\"We're creating a paradigm system to understand how this information is\nscrambled,\" said Pollanen. \"We have control over the environment, in this case,\nthe mechanical vibrations in the resonator, as well as the qubit.\"\n\n\"If you can understand how these environmental losses affect the system, you can\nuse that to your advantage,\" Kitzman said. \"The first step in solving a problem\nis understanding it.\"\n\nMSU is one of only a few places equipped and staffed to perform experiments on\nthese coupled qubit-mechanical resonator devices, Pollanen said, and the\nresearchers are excited to use their system for further exploration.

Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Klaus Pon\nvia AP\n\nThe Webb Space Telescope is marking one year of cosmic photographs with one of\nits best yet: the dramatic close-up of dozens of stars at the moment of birth.\n\nNASA unveiled the latest snapshot Wednesday, revealing 50 baby stars in a cloud\ncomplex 390 light-years away. A light-year is nearly 6 trillion miles (9.7\ntrillion kilometers).\n\nThe region is relatively small and quiet yet full of illuminated gases, jets of\nhydrogen and even dense cocoons of dust with the delicate beginnings of even\nmore stars.\n\nAll of the young stars [https://phys.org/tags/young+stars/] appear to be no\nbigger than our sun. Scientists said the breathtaking shot provides the best\nclarity yet of this brief phase of a star's life.\n\n\"It's like a glimpse of what our own system would have looked like billions of\nyears ago when it was forming,\" NASA program scientist Eric Smith told The\nAssociated Press.\n\nSmith pointed out that the starlight visible in the image actually left there\n390 years ago. On Earth in 1633, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei went on\ntrial in Rome for saying that the Earth revolved around the sun. The Vatican in\n1992 acknowledged Galileo was wronged.\n\nThis cloud complex, known as Rho Ophiuchi, is the closest star-forming region to\nEarth and is found in the sky near the border of the constellations Ophiuchus\nand Scorpius, the serpent-bearer and scorpion. With no stars in the foreground\nof the photo, NASA noted, the details stand out all the more. Some of the stars\ndisplay shadows indicating possible planets in the making, according to NASA.\n\n\n\nIt \"presents star birth as an impressionistic masterpiece,\" NASA Administrator\nBill Nelson said in a tweet.\n\nWebb—the largest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever launched into\nspace—has been churning out cosmic beauty shots for the past year. The first\npictures from the $10 billion infrared telescope were unveiled last July, six\nmonths after its liftoff from French Guiana.\n\nIt's considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, orbiting Earth for\n33 years. A joint NASA-European Space Agency effort, Webb scans the universe\nfrom a more distant perch, 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away.\n\nStill ahead for Webb: Astronomers hope to behold the earliest stars and galaxies\nof the universe while scouring the cosmos for any hints of life on planets\noutside our solar system.\n\n\"We haven't found one of them yet,\" Smith said. \"But we're still only one year\ninto the mission.\"\n\n© 2023 The Associated Press.

In physics, a sufficiently\nstrong barrier will prevent any incoming object from passing through it. But at\nthe quantum level, this isn’t strictly true. If you replace a tennis ball with a\nquantum particle and a solid wall with any quantum mechanical barrier, there’s a\nfinite probability that the particle will actually tunnel through the barrier,\nwhere it winds up being detected on the other side. It’s as though you threw the\ntennis ball at the wall and it went right through, unimpeded by the wall at all.\n\nOne of the questions you might seek to ask is whether there’s any delay in the\napparent motion of that quantum particle as it moves “through” the barrier via\nthe process of tunneling. In a 2019 experiment, scientists measured exactly\nthat, and found that the tunneling process itself was instantaneous\n[https://app.secure.griffith.edu.au/news/2019/03/19/measuring-tunneling-time-physicists-solve-great-mystery-of-the-quantum-world/];\nthere was no delay caused by the tunneling process at all. Some have questioned\nwhether this means, in the quantum realm, that it’s possible to violate the\nspeed limit imposed by relativity: the speed of light. Although your intuition\nmight suggest this possibility to you, it turns out not to be the case at all.\nAll processes, even quantum ones, still need to obey the rules of relativity,\nand can never exceed the speed of light. Here’s how to reconcile the\ninstantaneous nature of quantum tunneling with the fact that no information is\never transmitted faster than the speed of light.\n\nbounce ball\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bouncing_ball_strobe_edit.jpg?w=1800]\n\nIf you allow a classical particle, like a basketball or a tennis ball, to fall\nonto a hard surface like a table, you can be certain that it will bounce back.\nIf you were to perform this same experiment with a quantum particle, you’d find,\nquite surprisingly, that there was a finite chance that it would tunnel through\nto the other side of the table, going through the barrier as if it were no\nobstacle at all.\n\nCredit [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bouncing_ball_strobe_edit.jpg]:\nMichaelMaggs Edit by Richard Bartz/Wikimedia Commons\n\nWhen you think of the quantum Universe, chances are you think of tiny,\nindividual particles all zipping around and colliding into one another. This\nisn’t a bad picture to have in your head, but it doesn’t encapsulate what’s\ntruly going on at a quantum level. One of the counterintuitive aspects of the\nquantum nature of reality is that treating these quanta as particles, with\nspecific positions and motions at any instant in time, doesn’t fully explain\nwhat we observe. We know that there’s a fundamental uncertainty inherent to\ncertain properties (like the positions) of quantum particles, and we can only\ndescribe them fully by using a probabilistic description of reality.\n\nWhat this means is that if you take a single quantum particle, place it down at\nany one location, and ask “Where is it now?” at some later time, you won’t find\nit simply by multiplying its speed by the amount of time that’s passed. The\nquantum nature of this particle means that its position is defined by a\nwavefunction, not by one specific, well-determined value. Even at the limits of\nphysics, we can only tell you the relative probabilities of where you might find\nthe particle, and only through observation can you determine precisely what that\nparticle’s location actually is.\n\nspreading gaussian klein gordon wavepacket\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/X0PmB.jpg]\n\nAs time goes on, even for a simple, single particle, the quantum wavefunction\nthat describes its position will spread out, spontaneously, over time. This\nhappens for all quantum particles.\n\nCredit [http://physics-quest.org/Book_Chapter_Klein_Gordon.pdf]: Hans de\nVries/Physics Quest\n\nThis bizarre, counterintuitive property of quantum physics isn’t a limitation of\nour measurement equipment, but rather is a fundamental property of our reality\nand the rules that govern it. Whether you’re talking about:\n\n * a particle at rest,\n * a free particle traveling through space,\n * a bound particle (like an electron in an atom) that’s restricted as far as\n   where it’s allowed to be,\n * or a particle that encounters an obstacle that restricts what quantum states\n   it’s allowed to occupy,\n\nthere is no completely deterministic calculation you can do to uncover precisely\nwhere that particle is.\n\nAll you can calculate is the probability that the particle will be found in a\nparticular location or over a particular interval. Until you make a measurement,\nwhich reveals a property such as “position” to whatever measurement uncertainty\nyour measuring device allows, these probabilities are the only guide we have as\nto where the particle is. There is no such thing as a 100% “certain” position in\nquantum physics; the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ensures that there will\nalways be a finite, non-zero uncertainty to such a property.\n\nwave particle duality\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ezgif-2-c4e6e584dc.gif?w=750]\n\nTrajectories of a particle in a box (also called an infinite square well) in\nclassical mechanics (A) and quantum mechanics (B-F). In (A), the particle moves\nat constant velocity, bouncing back and forth. In (B-F), wavefunction solutions\nto the Time-Dependent Schrodinger Equation are shown for the same geometry and\npotential. The horizontal axis is position, the vertical axis is the real part\n(blue) or imaginary part (red) of the wavefunction. These stationary (B, C, D)\nand non-stationary (E, F) states only yield probabilities for the particle,\nrather than definitive answers for where it will be at a particular time.\n\nCredit\n[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:InfiniteSquareWellAnimation.gif]: Steve\nByrnes via Mathematica; Sbyrnes321/Wikimedia Commons\n\nThere’s an inherent uncertainty relation to position and momentum; that’s the\nmost commonly used example of quantum uncertainty. But there are others as well,\nincluding an uncertainty between a particle’s energy and between the time\ninterval over which a particle either exists in a certain quantum state or which\nyou’re attempting to measure its properties. If you’re thinking of this, you\nmight also think that a system that has a probability of tunneling from one side\nof a quantum barrier (like bound in an atom, or in a false minimum) to the other\nmust have a restriction on how quickly that transition could occur.\n\nMaybe it would depend on the size of the barrier, the thickness of the barrier,\nor some other factor that was related to its physical properties. After all, in\nthis Universe, everything should be limited by the speed of light.\n\nThe simplest setup we can imagine to test this is to take one single particle,\nlike an electron, that’s bound in a restricted system, like a hydrogen atom.\nThere’s a finite, non-zero probability that the electron will spontaneously\ntunnel to an unbound state. By imaging it with the proper equipment — ultra-fast\nphotons, for instance — you can accurately measure the time interval it takes to\ntunnel from a bound to an unbound state.\n\nquantum tunneling\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/QuantumTunnel.jpg?w=1362]\n\nIn many physical instances, you can find yourself trapped in a local, false\nminimum, unable to reach the lowest-energy state, which is known as the true\nminimum. Whether you receive a kick to hurdle the barrier, which can occur\nclassically, or whether you take the purely quantum mechanical path of quantum\ntunneling, going from one state to another is always possible so long as no\nfundamental conservation laws are violated.\n\nCredit [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:QuantumTunnel.jpg]:\nCranberry/Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn 2019, that’s precisely what researchers at the Australian Attosecond Science\nFacility accomplished\n[https://app.secure.griffith.edu.au/news/2019/03/19/measuring-tunneling-time-physicists-solve-great-mystery-of-the-quantum-world/],\nfinding that this transition, arguably the simplest of electron transitions,\ntakes at most 1.8 attoseconds, or 1.8 × 10-18 s. That means, at the speed of\nlight (299,792,458 m/s), we’re talking about traveling a distance of just 5.4\nångströms. According to Robert Sang, one of the lead researchers:\n\n“There’s a well-defined point where we can start that interaction, and there’s a\npoint where we know where that electron should come out [the interaction itself\nis] instantaneous. So anything that varies from that time we know that it’s\ntaken that long to go through the barrier… It came out to agree with the theory\nwithin experimental uncertainty being consistent with instantaneous tunneling.”\n\nWhile this has fascinating and profound implications for a variety of practical\napplications, including, for example, the construction of a quantum-limited\ntransistor, “instantaneous” in this context doesn’t mean that the electron moves\nfrom one physical location to another instantaneously, which would be in\nviolation of Einstein’s relativity.\n\nquantum tunneling\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ezgif-4-ae9f8a7c1472.gif?w=800]\n\nWhen a quantum particle approaches a barrier, it will most frequently interact\nwith it. But there is a finite probability of not only reflecting off of the\nbarrier, but tunneling through it. Although this new research implies that the\nstep of tunneling itself is instantaneous, that doesn’t mean you can cross from\none side of the barrier to the other in a time that’s less than the light-travel\ntime.\n\nCredit\n[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Quantum_Tunnelling_animation.gif]:\nYuvalr/Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt isn’t as though at one instant you can say “This particle is over there” and\nthen, some tiny amount of time later, you can say “This particle is now located\nhere instead.” If you could do that, you could simply take the measured\nchange-in-distance and divide it by the change-in-time that occurred; if that\nnumber came out to a number greater than 299,792,458 m/s, you’d conclude that\nyou had exceeded the speed of light. The experiment that was performed with an\nelectron within a hydrogen atom, which is remarkable for how precise and clean\nit was in only involving a single particle in a single, bound system, was not\nable to make that critical measurements.\n\nAll it could do was demonstrate that there’s no fundamental “quantum delay” in\nthe tunneling transition from a bound state to an unbound state. Nevertheless,\nexperiments like these are useful for exposing how physicists have managed to\nexploit a many-particle system in order to create the illusion of something\ntraveling faster than light: a result which gets misreported every few years in\nthe popular media.\n\nTo illustrate this, imagine you’ve got a set of quantum particles, bunched\ntogether into a tight pulse, tunneling or otherwise traveling through a barrier\nof some sort.\n\npulse light quantum tunnel barrier\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ezgif-2-7b72c5363c8e-1.gif?w=760]\n\nBy firing a pulse of light at a semi-transparent/semi-reflective thin medium,\nresearchers can measure the time it must take for these photons to tunnel\nthrough the barrier to the other side. Although the step of tunneling itself may\nbe instantaneous, the traveling particles are still limited by the speed of\nlight.\n\nCredit [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-018-0044-7]: J. Liang, L. Zhu &\nL.V. Wang, 2018, Light: Science & Applications\n\nIt’s truly remarkable at how successful we’ve become at imaging pulses that move\nat speeds that approach or even equal the speed of light, thanks to novel\ntechniques and technologies\n[http://www.inrs.ca/english/actualites/worlds-fastest-camera-freezes-time-10-trillion-frames-second].\nBecause we have these advanced imaging capabilities today, we can use multiple\nseparate measurements, over time, to illuminate your understanding of the\nquantum Universe, and to prevent you from being fooled by this type of erroneous\n“faster-than-light” claim.\n\nStep 1: The first thing you’ll want to measure, as precisely as possible, is\nwhere this pulse of physical quanta is located, in space and at a certain moment\nin time, before a quantum barrier is ever encountered.\n\nfaster than light setup [https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1.jpg]\n\nWhen you create a pulse of particles, whether those particles are massive or\nmassless (like light itself), there is always a distribution in space and time\ninherent to those particles. While you may not be able to measure this\ndistribution to infinite, arbitrary precision, your measurement apparatus is\ncapable of measuring a position and a time for even quantum particles\nsimultaneously.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel\n\nStep 2: The next thing you’ll want to do, before making the next measurement, is\nto calculate precisely where-and-when you’d expect the pulse of quanta to arrive\nunder the assumption that the pulse were to move at the speed of light and were\nto successfully tunnel through the barrier in front of it.\n\nfaster than light expectation\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2.jpg]\n\nNaively, if you sent particles from one location to another without a barrier or\nsomething to filter them out in between, you’d expect they would arrive at your\ndestination in a predictable amount of time that was set (or at least limited)\nby the speed of light. This is a straightforward calculation to perform: simply\n“translate” your particles forward by a distance that corresponds to the\nlight-travel distance over the amount of time between the initial and final\nmeasurements.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel\n\nStep 3: Now, you’ll want to make that measurement for precisely where the pulse\nis located at a later instant in time, after it successfully tunnels through the\nbarrier.\n\nBut, when you make that measurement, you shouldn’t be surprised if you learn\nthat the pulse that you detect on the other side of the barrier — the pulse that\nmust’ve tunneled through the barrier in order to get there — might appear to\nhave moved faster than the speed of light would seem to permit!\n\nfaster than light fooled ourselves\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3.jpg]\n\nIf all you did was measure the start position, time and end position, and time\nof a set of particles that were sent toward and wound up passing through a\nquantum barrier, you might (falsely) conclude that these arriving particles had\ntraveled faster than the speed of light. Don’t worry, they didn’t; you’re not\nobserving the full suite of particles, only the (possibly weighted) portion that\nmade it through your quantum barrier.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel\n\nThis is a tricky situation, as you might think, based on what you just read\nabout the speed of quantum tunneling being instantaneous, that this means that\nparticles can travel infinitely fast, breaking the speed of light, through a\nquantum mechanical barrier of finite, non-zero thickness.\n\nThat’s the misinterpretation that always crops up, and how people fool\nthemselves (and unscrupulous news organizations try to fool you\n[https://www.iflscience.com/physics/quantum-tunneling-is-so-quick-it-could-be-instantaneous/])\ninto thinking they’re breaking the speed of light.\n\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/horizontal_black.svg?w=128&h=96&crop=1]\n\nTravel the Universe with astrophysicist Ethan Siegel. Subscribers will get the\nnewsletter every Saturday. All aboard!\n\nBut that’s not what’s happening here, or in any of these so-called\n“faster-than-light” demonstrations. Instead, all that’s happening here is that\nonly a portion of the quantum particles found in the pulse manage to\nsuccessfully tunnel through the barrier. The majority of the particles do what a\n(classical) tennis ball would do: they bounce back, failing to arrive at the\ndestination. The “trick” to fooling yourself into believing that you’ve created\na faster-than-light system is that it’s possible to front-load which particles\nmake it through the barrier, preferentially cutting off the particles in the\nback of the pulse.\n\nIf you do this without being sufficiently careful, you’ll falsely measure a\nfaster-than-light speed for the overall pulse, even though no individual\nparticle actually ever exceeds the speed of light.\n\nfaster than light resolution\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4.jpg]\n\nIf you were to somehow track the individual motion of each and every particle\nthat you launched toward your destination, you’d find that the ones that made it\nwere simply part of the front-end of the initial pulse, and that no actual\nparticles were traveling faster than light itself.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel\n\nSo what does it mean, then, for the researchers to assert that quantum tunneling\nis an instantaneous process that occurs without any delay?\n\nSimply that the actual process of tunneling itself, where the transition occurs\nfrom being in a bound state on one side of a quantum barrier to an unbound state\non the other side, doesn’t take any extra, additional time on top of all the\nother physical effects. It means that there’s no inherent “quantum delay” for\nthe process of tunneling to occur.\n\nBut as the particles in your system move a finite distance over a finite amount\nof time, they’re still fundamentally limited by Einstein’s relativity. This\nrestriction applies to each and every particle, under all circumstances, with no\nexceptions. It’s an incredible feat that scientists have now measured the speed\nof a quantum transition from an electron to go from a bound state to an unbound\nstate directly, for a single particle, determining that there is no delay\noccurring that’s inherent to the quantum tunneling process itself. However, at\nno point is any quantum particle actually traveling faster than light. That’s a\nphenomenon that’s restricted, at least as far as we know, to the realm of\nscience fiction alone."

At stake was a chance to see inside Jupiter’s mysterious icy\nmoons.\n\nThe stakes were already high before the spacecraft ever left the ground. ESA’s\nJupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) was designed by Airbus to conduct an\nunprecedented investigation of the Jupiter system and its family of icy moons.\n\nA key to that investigation is the Radar for Icy Moon Exploration (RIME)\nantenna, which is part of Juice’s comprehensive suite of ten science\ninstruments. Once in the Jupiter system, RIME will be used to remotely probe the\nsubsurface of Jupiter’s icy moons. Its radar signals will penetrate the moons to\na depth of 9 km, and reveal details of between 50 and 140 m across. This will\ngive insight into their geology and provide unique data to understand the\nhabitability of these remote, icy moons.\n\nJuice RIME Antenna Folded\n[https://scitechdaily.com/images/Juice-RIME-Antenna-Folded-777x777.jpg]https://scitechdaily.com/images/Juice-RIME-Antenna-Folded.jpg\n\nJuice’s RIME antenna, folded up ready for deployment.

Credit: ESA/Juice/JMC\n\nBut to succeed in collecting this data, scientists had to first get the\nspacecraft and its instruments into space – and that meant folding up some of\nthe hardware.\n\nAt 16 m in length, the RIME antenna was too long to fit inside the nose cone of\nthe Ariane 5 rocket that launched Juice into space. It was therefore constructed\nin two booms of four segments each. Of those eight segments, three would deploy\non one side of the spacecraft, three on the other side, and two would remain\nfixed on the spacecraft. For launch, the three deployable segments were folded\nback onto the fixed segment and held in place by two brackets.\n\nOnce in space, devices called non-explosive actuators (NEAs) would be remotely\nactivated one after the other from the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC),\nDarmstadt, Germany. Each NEA would remove a holding pin from its bracket,\nallowing that section to spring into place.\n\nAnd that’s where the problems began.\n\nThe procedure to deploy Juice’s RIME antenna began on April 17, 2023, three days\nafter the launch, and with everything having proceeded smoothly up until that\npoint. Continuing this trend, the first step went without a hitch. Two\nmonitoring cameras, mounted onboard the spacecraft, were used to follow the RIME\ndeployment. From the downloads, the antenna segment was visible on one image,\nand then not on the next. In between the images, the NEA had fired, the pin had\nreleased and the antenna segment had snapped into place. A check of the external\ncamera’s image showed the segment in place, and the telemetry data also\nconfirmed this. It showed that the spacecraft was oscillating as expected from\nthe sudden deployment of the boom, and that the Attitude and Orbit Control\nSystem (AOCS) was correcting for the last of these movements.

The telemetry arrived before the\nimages, but something was wrong. The expected oscillation was not showing. A few\nseconds later, the camera image came back. The boom segment was still clearly\nvisible in its stowed configuration. The deployment had failed.\n\n“You experience a state of disbelief,” says Ronan, “The most unwanted situation\nis happening. We checked the picture two, three, four times. We tried again to\nactivate the actuator, but nothing happened.”\n\nJuice’s stuck but moving RIME antenna is captured by the Juice Monitoring Camera\non board the spacecraft.

Credit: ESA/Juice/JMC\n\nAlso watching in a state of professional disbelief was the team at Airbus\nDefence and Space, Toulouse, France. Chosen as the spacecraft’s prime contractor\nin 2015, they were responsible for leading the design, construction, and testing\nof the spacecraft and bringing in other companies to supply components, systems\nand instruments as needed.\n\n“We knew that we had to quickly try to understand what had happened, and then\ntry to find a workaround,” says Frédéric Faye, Airbus’s chief engineer for\nJuice.\n\nThe very next morning, with the disbelief banished from their minds, the teams\ngathered online for a teleconference to share their insights and discuss the\nanomaly. On one hand, they knew they had to find some way to free the stuck\nsegment\n[https://scitechdaily.com/sticky-situation-critical-antenna-on-esas-jupiter-icy-moons-explorer-fails-to-deploy/],\nbut on the other, they knew that they could not do anything that would\ncompromise the deployment of the other segments, or indeed the rest of the\nspacecraft.\n\nThe first thought that occurred to the teams was that perhaps some ice had\nformed on the pin holding the segment in place. Every time a spacecraft leaves\nEarth, it finds itself in a cold, airless environment. This sudden and dramatic\nloss of air pressure means that a small amount of water vapor will suddenly\nescape from the material used to make the craft. This can then freeze onto the\nincredibly cold surfaces of the spacecraft.\n\nSince there are no heaters on the spacecraft near RIME, removing the ice would\nmean rotating the spacecraft so that the antenna faced the Sun. But, the surface\nof the spacecraft holding RIME was designed to be a ‘cold face’, meaning that it\nwas never intended to be exposed to the direct sunlight just after launch. Nor\nwere the components, instruments and systems that were attached to it.\n\nAfter several days of study, the team began gradually slewing the spacecraft so\nthat the surface was illuminated. “We did eight slews over two weeks to\nilluminate the RIME bracket,” says Angela Dietz, Spacecraft Operations Manager\nat ESOC. Each time they exposed the surface for longer, carefully watching the\ntelemetry from the onboard sensors to understand the limits of this operation.\nAt first, the maneuver lasted just 25 minutes. By the end, they felt comfortable\nexposing the surface for 73 minutes at a time.\n\nSimultaneously, other possible recovery scenarios were being contemplated.\n\nIf it were not ice holding RIME shut, and the pin had simply stuck, then perhaps\nshaking the spacecraft would jog it loose – although the word ‘shaking’ is too\nextreme to describe the actual motion.\n\nThe spacecraft weighs six tonnes and the thrusters onboard can only rock it back\nand forth very gently. Nevertheless, the teams felt it was worth trying. The\nstuck pin probably only needed moving by a millimeter or two, but the teams had\nto be careful. They could not risk harming anything else with a violent jolt of\nthe spacecraft. So, as the team had done with the heating, they began testing\nthis maneuver cautiously.\n\n“We did several thruster firings and used the main engine, often linked with the\nheating up slews. The thrusters were even fired in a certain sequence to try to\nshake off the stacked boom, but we only saw small movements within the bracket,”\nsays Angela.\n\nAnd so the team moved on to other ideas.\n\nThe manufacturer of the antenna, German company SpaceTech, also proposed a\nrecovery plan. Effectively, it was to continue deploying the other four sections\nof the antenna as if nothing had happened. They knew that as each NEA fired, it\nwould produce a small mechanical shock in the rest of the antenna that could\ndislodge the stuck pin.\n\nThen, the manufacturer made a breakthrough. The engineers at SpaceTech managed\nto reproduce the anomaly with a model of the antenna that had been used for\ntesting and confirmed that the firing of the closest NEA usually managed to\ndislodge the stuck pin. It was also identified that to increase the chances of a\nsuccessful outcome, the antenna should be heated by exposure to sunlight.\n\nThis was because although the engineering model had been fully tested at the\ncold temperatures of space, the actual flight model had not. The team concluded\nthat the extremely cold conditions encountered during the failed NEA release\nmight have been a contributing factor, and so the antenna should be warmed by\nthe Sun before all future actuations to get it as close to ‘room temperature’ as\npossible, where they knew it worked.\n\nArmed with several ideas for how to recover the instrument, the teams decided to\nmeet in person to decide the way forward. At a technical workshop held at\nSpaceTech, the teams decided to try the heating first. If that did not work,\nthey would proceed with firing the other NEAs, having warmed them first with\nsunlight. “This exercise to put down a plan and get all the teams working\ntowards it was really beneficial,” says Ronan.\n\nIt was now several weeks since the anomaly had occurred and pressure was\nmounting. The mission had a timetable to keep and as important as RIME is, it\nwas only one instrument on the spacecraft. “To me this was the most complicated\nthing during the recovery,” says Guillaume Chambon of Airbus’s Technical\nAuthority Team. Guillaume was placed in charge of managing the Airbus side of\nthe recovery. “You have to be fast enough to act because everyone is expecting\nyou to make progress, but you need to take enough time to consider all the side\neffects of what you are proposing,” he says.\n\nOne afternoon, while contemplating the rescue attempt, Guillaume did indeed\nrealize a potential problem. If they went ahead with the nominal deployment\nsequence, there was a chance that two segments of the antenna could collide.\n\nOn May 12 RIME was finally jolted into life when the flight control team fired a\nmechanical device called a ‘non-explosive actuator’ (NEA), located in the jammed\nbracket. This delivered a shock that moved the pin by a matter of millimeters\nand allowed the antenna to unfold. Credit: ESA/Juice/JMC\n\nRecall that the RIME antenna is composed of six deploying segments, three on\neach side of the spacecraft. In the nominal deployment scenario, an NEA would be\nfired first on one side of the antenna and then on the other. However, if they\ndid this now, and the stuck section came free, then the two sides of the antenna\nwould be deploying together in opposite directions and could collide.\n\nSo, the teams agreed to reorder the deployment sequence, and the recovery\nattempts began. First, the spacecraft was heated to drive off any ice, but the\nantenna remained fixed.\n\nAnd so it became obvious that the only possibility to recover the antenna was to\nheat the antenna again, and then continue with the deployment in the hopes that\nthe shocks from the other NEAs would unjam the pin. Their analysis had shown\nthem that this would give the best chance of success but each NEA could only be\nfired once. In other words, it was all or nothing.\n\nOn May 12 RIME was finally jolted into life when the flight control team fired a\nmechanical device called a ‘non-explosive actuator’ (NEA), located in the jammed\nbracket. This delivered a shock that moved the pin by a matter of millimeters\nand allowed the antenna to unfold. Credit: ESA/Juice/JMC, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n\nIt was around 2 pm on May 12 that the teams gathered at their respective\nconsoles and began this final attempt. The command was sent and the teams\nwatched the telemetry for any hint of an oscillation that would indicate\nsuccess. There it was: movement on the spacecraft. But was it the correct\nmovement? Had they dislodged the stuck segment?\n\nWhen the camera downloaded, the image showed them everything they needed to\nknow.\n\nTotal success. The three segments of the antenna that should be deployed, were\ndeployed. “In the operations team we became quietly confident,” says Angela.\n\nBut the job was not over yet. They were only halfway through the full deployment\nprocedure. One other NEA still needed to be fired to deploy the second boom\nbefore RIME could assume its final operating configuration. And if anything, the\npressure felt by some on the team was even greater than before because now the\nteam knew that it was possible for the pins to jam. And now that just one pin\nremained, it was the most critical of all.\n\nIf any of the previous ones had jammed, the team could have fired the next in\nsequence and hoped that the shock would finish the job – as it had on the\noriginal stuck segment. But now, there were no more NEAs to fire. Right at the\nfinish line, they could still be defeated if the pin jammed.\n\nJUICE Mission Operators Celebrating RPWI Deployment\n[https://scitechdaily.com/images/JUICE-Mission-Operators-Celebrating-RPWI-Deployment-777x583.jpg]https://scitechdaily.com/images/JUICE-Mission-Operators-Celebrating-RPWI-Deployment.jpg\n\nJuice mission operators celebrating the successful deployment of another\ninstrument, RPWI. Credit: ESA\n\nIt was at this point that Cyril Cavel, the Juice project manager for Airbus\nfound himself thinking about the scientists who were depending on them. Some had\neven been working on the antenna for decades. “RIME was an industrial delivery\nto these people. Without this antenna, the radar experiment would be either very\nreduced or even dead. It would be far more than just a shame,” he says.\n\nIndeed, the chance to truly learn what was below the icy surfaces of those\nenchanting moons could have been significantly diminished or even lost for the\ncurrent generation of planetary scientists.\n\n“We knew that, even though the RIME was one instrument out of ten, a failure to\nfully open the antenna would have degraded the scientific performance of the\nmission and compromised the – until that moment – excellent image of Juice and\nESA to the external world,” says Giuseppe Sarri, ESA’s Juice Project Manager.\n\nAs a result, the team took one final precaution. By now, the final bracket had\nbeen in sunlight for its maximum permitted time that day of 73 minutes. As a\nresult, its temperature was higher than the ambient temperature at which it had\nbeen tested in the labs in Germany. To reproduce the conditions of that lab as\nclosely as possible, the team took the decision to rotate the spacecraft, moving\nthe antenna away from the Sun, and wait for three to four hours for its\ntemperature to drop.\n\n“Those three to four hours were very long,” says Frédéric.\n\nAt the end of the wait, when the conditions were right, the command was sent.\n\n\n\nThe NEA activated, the telemetry showed Juice oscillating as the final segment\ndeployed, the AOCS cut in and stabilised the spacecraft. Finally, the cameras\nconfirmed the teams’ victory, RIME was now in its fully deployed configuration.\n\nFor Ronan, the relief at seeing the deployment was tinged with a familiar sense\nof disbelief. “It was a bit like the first day of the incident. There was a\nfeeling of disbelief because four weeks of an enormous amount of pressure was\njust suddenly gone. I couldn’t quite believe it, despite seeing the pictures,”\nhe says.\n\n“When RIME was eventually released I could almost see tears in the eyes of my\ncolleagues,” says Giuseppe, before adding, “But we were positive from the\nbeginning and the Champagne was already in the fridge…”\n\nOnce the bubbly was drunk and the team suitably rested, the flight controllers\nat ESOC moved on to the other deployments necessary on the spacecraft, all of\nwhich have now been completed successfully. And the RIME anomaly teams at ESA,\nAirbus and SpaceTech, are just wrapping up their understanding of the original\ncause so that it can be avoided in the future on similar systems.\n\nAnd the Juice mission itself is once again on a path to complete success."

The study, conducted by a team of\nscientists at Harvard Medical School, has published the first chemical approach\nto reprogram cells to a younger state. Previously, this was only achievable\nusing a powerful gene therapy.\n\nOn July 12, 2023, researchers Jae-Hyun Yang, Christopher A.

Martinez, Alexander Behn, Ryan Rogers-Hammond, Suzanne Angeli,\nVadim N. Gladyshev, and David A. Sinclair from Harvard Medical School,\nUniversity of Maine and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) published a\nnew research paper in Aging, titled, \"Chemically induced reprogramming to\nreverse cellular aging.\"\n\nThe team's findings build upon the discovery that the expression of specific\ngenes, called Yamanaka factors, could convert adult cells into induced\npluripotent stem cells\n[https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/Induced-Pluripotent-Stem-(iPS)-Cells-Discovery-Advantages-and-CRISPR-Cas9-Gene-Editing.aspx]\n(iPSCs). This Nobel Prize-winning discovery raised the question of whether it\nmight be possible to reverse cellular aging without causing cells to become too\nyoung and turn cancerous.\n\nIn this new study, the researchers screened for molecules that could, in\ncombination, reverse cellular aging and rejuvenate human cells. They developed\nhigh-throughput cell-based assays to distinguish young cells from old and\nsenescent cells, including transcription-based aging clocks and a real-time\nnucleocytoplasmic protein compartmentalization (NCC) assay. In an exciting\ndiscovery, the team has identified six chemical cocktails that restore NCC and\ngenome-wide transcript profiles to youthful states and reverse transcriptomic\nage in less than a week.\n\nThe Harvard researchers previously demonstrated that it is indeed possible to\nreverse cellular aging without uncontrolled cell growth by virally-introducing\nspecific Yamanaka genes into cells. Studies on the optic nerve, brain tissue,\nkidney, and muscle have shown promising results, with improved vision and\nextended lifespan observed in mice and, recently, a report of improved vision in\nmonkeys.\n\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n * Does a healthy diet protect against dementia and slow the pace of biological\n   aging?\n   [https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230706/Does-a-healthy-diet-protect-against-dementia-and-slow-the-pace-of-biological-aging.aspx]\n * Tiny sea creature offers new clues to regeneration and aging\n   [https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230630/Tiny-sea-creature-offers-new-clues-to-regeneration-and-aging.aspx]\n * Alcohol use disorder can lead to accelerated aging of brain morphology\n   [https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230704/Alcohol-use-disorder-can-lead-to-accelerated-aging-of-brain-morphology.aspx]\n\nThe implications of this new discovery are far-reaching, opening avenues for\nregenerative medicine and, potentially, whole-body rejuvenation.

        "content": "Recently astronomers have been able to associate two seemingly unrelated\nphenomena: an explosive event known as a fast radio burst and the change in\nspeed of a spinning magnetar. And now new research suggests that the cause of\nboth of these is the destruction of an asteroid by a magnetar.\n\nFor years astronomers were stumped by the origins of fast radio bursts, which\nare flashes of radio energy that last less than a second. Since fast radio\nbursts were detected in distant galaxies, they must be incredibly energetic\nevents. But it wasn’t until astronomers caught a fast radio burst occurring in\nour own galaxy that we discovered the likely culprit: magnetars.\n\nMagnetars are a special kind of pulsar\n[https://www.universetoday.com/152071/astronomy-jargon-magnetars/], which are\nrapidly spinning neutron stars. When neutron stars first form, they can carry\nwith them enormously strong magnetic fields – the strongest magnetic fields in\nthe entire universe. And so these super-magnetized neutron stars get a new name:\nmagnetars. \n\nThe connection to fast radio bursts was made when astronomers noted noticed a\nmagnetar glitching. Magnetars rotate with very precise speeds. But occasionally\nthat speed can change suddenly, where it shifts to either a slower or faster\nspeed. Astronomers noticed a glitch in a magnetar around the same time that a\nfast radio burst was generated. Since magnetars carry enormous amounts of energy\n[https://www.universetoday.com/158556/new-observations-confirm-that-a-magnetar-has-a-solid-surface-and-no-atmosphere/],\nthey could potentially explain the origin of fast radio bursts.\n\nBut while we knew that these two processes were linked, we didn’t know what led\nto them. Now in a new research paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17316], a team\nof astrophysicists proposed that asteroids have something to do with it.\n\n\n\nAsteroids are thought to be common around magnetars. Since magnetars are the\nleftovers of giant stars after they die, parts of their solar systems will\nremain intact. And so it’s likely that magnetars are surrounded by a host of\nasteroids and other assorted debris. In the scenario painted by the researchers,\noccasionally an asteroid can wander too close to its magnetar. The magnetar, in\naddition to having a strong magnetic field, also has an extremely powerful\ngravitational force\n[https://www.universetoday.com/160112/magnetars-are-extreme-in-every-way-even-their-volcanoes/].\nIf the asteroid gets too close, the gravitational force can rip the asteroid\napart.\n\nWhen the asteroid gets ripped apart its angular momentum has to go somewhere. If\nit happens to follow a path that goes along with the rotation of the magnetar,\nthen it will increase the speed of the magnetar once it gets disrupted. This\ncauses the glitch. If the asteroid is moving in the opposite direction it will\nslightly slow down the magnetar, leading to what’s known as an anti-glitch.\n\nEither way the debris of the torn-apart asteroid now gets caught up in the\nextremely strong magnetic fields. This causes the magnetic fields to tangle up\non themselves and release their pent up energy in the form of a fast radio\nburst.\n\nLastly, the surviving debris eventually rains down onto the magnetar surface\nwhich releases its own kind of flares that we can potentially detect. It is a\nplausible scenario to explain how exactly magnetars can lead to fast radio\nbursts, and it shows that even the tiniest objects in a solar system, like\nasteroids, can lead to very big impacts."

But in that time, I’ve either\nbeen warring with enemy Spartans and Elites, messing around in Forge, or playing\nGrifball.

The houses are\nsmall and everything outside of the houses is freezing. It’s nice that you can\nget around pretty easily underground, for sure. And you’ve got something of a\ngarage! But it’s a small area, and if you try to walk out and explore, you are\nshot to death by “The Guardians.” Who are the Guardians? Literally no one knows.\nThere’s Halo 5 unfortunately never been a game to explore this mysterious\nmurderous force holding you captive like an overprotective parent or serial\nkiller.\n\n\n#21 — COLD STORAGE\n\n[https://hard-drive.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cold-storage.jpg.webp]\n\nYou ever check out a house or an apartment and already see black mold growing on\nthe bathroom ceiling?

It’s literally all sand. Not to state the\nobvious, but if Anakin Skywalker showed up there, he’d have a straight up panic\nattack. And yea, there’s kinda buildings, but not really. The one thing Sandtrap\nhas going for it is the Elephants, which I think kids would have a lot of fun\ndriving very slowly around town.

Unfortunately, it also reeks,\n100% of the time, of fish. Your children are going to be bullied at Old Mombasa\nMiddle School so hard, they’re going to hate you for the rest of your life.\n\n\n#18 — ISOLATION\n\n[https://hard-drive.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/isolation.jpg.webp]\n\nIsolation is a major fixer upper. The backyard is disgusting (I think I found\nsome used needlers while walking around?) and the basement is infested with\nFlood. But maybe if you get a reaaaaaaaally good mortgage price, you could clean\nit up and finish that basement? Get a big TV and a bar down there? I mean, you\nhave to admit those giant walls surrounding the property are cool. That’s old\nschool. They don’t make ‘em like that anymore!\n\n\n#17 —GUARDIAN \n\n[https://hard-drive.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/guardian.jpg.webp]\n\nIf I was a real estate agent, I would describe Guardian as a “quaint picturesque\njungle location perfect for any young couples looking to buy a starter home.”\nSure, it’s super easy to fall to your death in a number of places here. But of\nall the Halo maps where that’s true (and there are many!), this is the prettiest\none. And isn’t that worth something?\n\n\n#16 — GHOST TOWN\n\n[https://hard-drive.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ghost-town.jpg.webp]\n\nWanna live in a mansion? What about one that has basically fallen apart????\nThat’s Ghost Town. Yeah, you’ve got a huge house that has room to host all your\nfriends at a big fancy dinner party, but good luck trying not to get rained on\nat night when there’s a giant goddamn tree sticking out of your roof.

So enjoy living in\nsome boxes on some sand in the middle of nowhere. This is one of the greatest\nclass divides of the entire Halo universe.\n\n\n#14 — NARROWS\n\n[https://hard-drive.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/narrows.jpg.webp]\n\nOK I’m gonna be straight with you here. Narrows can be a great place to live —\nit’s roomy, pretty, and has two lovely bases for you to set up your furniture\nand television. But you really really need to consider this if you’re going to\nmove to Narrows: how smart are your kids? Now I don’t mean to offend, but\nseriously, think about it. Because if you’re worried they’re even a little bit\ndumb, don’t move to Narrows. They’re going to get in the man-cannons wrong and\nfall. I’ve seen it happen SO many times.\n\n\n#13 — RAT’S NEST\n\n[https://hard-drive.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rats-nest.jpg.webp]\n\nRat’s Nest is ugly, it’s named after a place where rats live, and it’s covered\nin dirt. But you cannot deny that it has a lot of room and a cool road for your\nkid to learn how to drive a mongoose, and eventually a warthog, on. That’s a\nlot. You just have to make sure you keep the place operational — checking the\nboiler and such, like you’re Jack Torrence in a really ugly version of The\nShining. But you’re not gonna go crazy, right? You’re gonna get so much writing\ndone!\n\n\n#12 — ORBITAL\n\n[https://hard-drive.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/orbital.jpg.webp]\n\nI don’t know what it is about Orbital, but I’ve been playing Halo 3 my whole\nlife and I still get lost here. No idea how to navigate this place at all. So\nno, I’m not going to be moving my family to Orbital and I don’t care if you\nthink that’s dumb. Its layout simply refuses to solidify in my brain.\n\n\n#11 — HERETIC \n\n[https://hard-drive.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/heretic.jpg.webp]\n\nSure, it’s kind of cool to live on a spaceship, but Heretic is small af. It’s\nlike trying to raise a child in a studio apartment, because really, there’s not\nany rooms or anything. It’s just a big living room and some circular hallways.\nAnd yet, despite being such a tiny environment to raise a family, boy would it\nbe a nightmare to clean. Imagine climbing up onto the energy sword platform\ntrying to scrub purple metal with a washcloth. Absolutely not.\n\nWe may earn commission from links on this page but we only include products we\nthink Hard Drive readers will like. Learn more > [https://hard-drive.net/about/]"

        "content": "Scientists at Leipzig University, in collaboration with colleagues at Vilnius\nUniversity in Lithuania, have developed a new method to measure the smallest\ntwists and torques of molecules within milliseconds. The method makes it\npossible to track the gene recognition of CRISPR-Cas protein complexes, also\nknown as “genetic scissors”, in real time and with the highest resolution. With\nthe data obtained, the recognition process can be accurately characterised and\nmodelled to improve the precision of the genetic scissors. The results obtained\nby the team led by Professor Ralf Seidel and Dominik Kauert from the Faculty of\nPhysics and Earth Sciences have now been published in the prestigious journal\nNature Structural and Molecular Biology.\n\nWhen bacteria are attacked by a virus, they can defend themselves with a\nmechanism that fends off the genetic material introduced by the intruder. The\nkey is CRISPR-Cas protein complexes. It is only in the last decade that their\nfunction for adaptive immunity in microorganisms has been discovered and\nelucidated. With the help of an embedded RNA, the CRISPR complexes recognize a\nshort sequence in the attacker's DNA. The mechanism of sequence recognition by\nRNA has since been used to selectively switch off and modify genes in any\norganism. This discovery revolutionized genetic engineering and was already\nhonored in 2020 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to Emmanuelle\nCharpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna.\n\nOccasionally, however, CRISPR complexes also react to gene segments that differ\nslightly from the sequence specified by the RNA. This leads to undesirable side\neffects in medical applications. \"The causes of this are not yet well\nunderstood, as the process could not be observed directly until now,\" says\nDominik Kauert, who worked on the project as a PhD student.\n\n\nNANOSCALE PROCESSES TRACKED IN DETAIL\n\nTo better understand the recognition process, the team led by Professor Ralf\nSeidel and Dominik Kauert took advantage of the fact that the DNA double helix\nof the target sequence is unwound during recognition to enable base pairing with\nthe RNA. \"The central question of the project was therefore whether the\nunwinding of a piece of DNA that is only 10 nanometres (nm) long could be\ntracked in real time at all,\" says Kauert.\n\nTo observe the unwinding process in detail, the scientists had to make it\nvisible to the microscope. To achieve this goal, the team drew on the\nachievements of DNA nanotechnology, which can be used to create any\nthree-dimensional DNA nanostructure. Using this so-called DNA origami technique,\nthe researchers constructed a 75 nm long DNA rotor arm with a gold nanoparticle\nattached to its end. In the experiment, the unwinding of the 2 nm thin and 10 nm\nlong DNA sequence was transferred to the rotation of the gold nanoparticle along\na circle with a diameter of 160 nm – this movement can be magnified and tracked\nusing a special microscope setup.\n\nWith this new method, the researchers were able to observe the sequence\nrecognition by the CRISPR Cascade complex almost base pair by base pair.\nSurprisingly, base pairing with the RNA is not energetically advantageous,\nmeaning that the complex is only unstably bound during sequence recognition.\nOnly when the entire sequence is recognized does stable binding occur and the\nDNA is subsequently destroyed. If it is the \"wrong\" target sequence, the process\nis aborted.\n\n\nFINDINGS WILL HELP IN SELECTING SUITABLE RNA SEQUENCES\n\nThe fact that the recognition process sometimes produces incorrect results is\ndue to its stochastic nature, i.e. to random molecular movements, as the\nresearchers have now been able to demonstrate. \"Sequence recognition is driven\nby thermal fluctuations in base pairing,\" says Kauert. With the data obtained,\nit was possible to create a thermodynamic model of sequence recognition that\ndescribes the recognition of deviating sequence segments.

        "content": "A retired cosmological theory should be given a second chance at explaining\nanomalies in our Universe, according to theoretical physicist Rajendra Gupta\nfrom the University of Ottawa in Canada.\n\nBy marrying the existing expanding Universe theory with a fringe explanation\n[https://www.science.org/content/article/tired-light-hypothesis-gets-re-tired]\ncalled the tired light hypothesis\n[https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/t/Tired+Light], Gupta has found the Big\nBang [https://www.sciencealert.com/big-bang] could have taken place an\nastonishing 26.7 billion years ago. That's twice as old as current models\npredict.\n\nThose added years could explain why the most distant galaxies observed\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/jwst-captures-details-of-the-four-most-distant-galaxies-ever-seen]\nlook surprisingly mature\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/astronomers-detect-6-massive-galaxies-so-old-they-cant-be-explained-by-science]\nfor star-cities that ought to have only been around for half a billion years.\n\nEstimating the age of the Universe isn't unlike guessing a child's birthday\nbased on their height. Objects in the distance – in every direction – look a\nlittle redder than their signature patterns of light might have us expect. The\nmost likely explanation is that space expands, stretching those light waves\napart like a pulled spring.\n\nAs light takes time to travel, redder light is older light, having been pulled\nover a greater distance. Working backward on this estimated growth rate, it's\npossible to use expansion to determine when the Universe was a compact volume\nseething with concentrated energy.\n\nHowever, this hasn't been the only attempt to explain why light in the distance\nlooks redder. In 1929, Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Zwicky] suggested light simply lost its\npuff over such vast stretches of space. Less energy means lower frequency and\nlonger wavelengths, shifting the spectrum of bright, distant objects.\n\nBasically, the light got 'tired'.\n\nWhile Zwicky would later land upon a landmark discovery\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/warped-starlight-could-be-the-signpost-that-points-to-dark-matter-in-the-milky-way]\nestablishing the great mystery of dark matter\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/dark-matter], his tired light\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired_light] hypothesis suffered too many\nproblems [https://astro.ucla.edu/~wright/tiredlit.htm] to make the grade,\nleaving the expanding Universe model as the theory of choice.\n\nAs Gupta puts it in his recently published proposal\n[https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stad2032/7221343],\nthat doesn't mean the two concepts are mutually exclusive. A combination might\neven help resolve why the earliest quasars and galaxies appear to be billions of\nyears old.\n\nIt might also help explain why they look smaller than expected despite their\nwell-developed masses.\n\nGupta's hybrid hypothesis presumes the Universe really is as big as we believe,\nhaving expanded to its size from a Big Bang event in the past. He starts with\ntwo expanding Universe models: one based on standard assumptions about the\nevenness and flatness of the cosmos and a second one that introduces some tweaks\ninvolving what's known as a coupling constant\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_constant].\n\nCoupling constants describe interactions of forces between particles, such as\nthe way the electromagnetic fields of two protons held in close proximity will\naffect each other's behavior in specific ways.\n\nAll forces have a coupling constant, which isn't necessarily constant at all,\nchanging with energy. This leaves room for coupling constants to vary enough to\naffect how light behaves. If this constant has changed over time, our\ncalculations on the age of the Universe could be out by a significant amount.\n\n\"Our newly-devised model stretches the galaxy formation time by several billion\nyears, making the universe 26.7 billion years old, and not 13.7 as previously\nestimated,\" says\n[https://www.uottawa.ca/about-us/media/news/reinventing-cosmology-uottawa-research-puts-age-universe-267-137-billion-years]\nGupta.\n\nOne of the problems with tired light theory is that a loss of energy in a light\nwave would correspond with a loss of momentum, affecting the appearance of far\ndistant objects. With ancient galaxies looking unusually petite, this conflict\nmight actually be a reason to reconsider the hypothesis.\n\nAs happens whenever observations don't quite align with expectations, scientists\nthrow every idea they can think of at the problem to see what sticks. Some are\nmundane, some quirky, and some dig up the corpses of dead hypotheses to see if\nthey have heartbeats after all.\n\nWhatever explanation is left standing in the end, it will almost certainly\nchange how we look at our Universe, and its dazzling contents, evolve.\n\nThis research was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical\nSociety\n[https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stad2032/7221343]."

They're also widespread in the Universe, so they can't be taken as a clear\nsignature of the presence of life. That creates an annoying situation regarding\nthe search for evidence of life on Mars, which clearly has some organic\nchemicals despite the harsh environment.\n\nBut we don't know whether these are the right kinds of molecules to be\nindications of life. For the moment, we also lack the ability to tear apart\nMartian rocks, isolate the molecules, and figure out exactly what they are. In\nthe meantime, our best option is to get some rough information on them and\nfigure out the context of where they're found on Mars. And a big step has been\nmade in that direction with the publication of results from imaging done by the\nPerseverance rover.\n\n\nASK SHERLOC\n\nThe instrument that's key to the new work has a name that pretty much tells you\nit was designed to handle this specific question: Scanning Habitable\nEnvironments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals\n[https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/sherloc/] (SHERLOC).\nSHERLOC comes with a deep-UV laser to excite molecules into fluorescing, and the\nwavelengths they fluoresce at can tell us something about the molecules present.\nIt also has the hardware to do Raman spectroscopy\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy] simultaneously.\n\nCollectively, these two capabilities indicate what kinds of molecules are\npresent, though they can't typically identify specific chemicals. And,\ncritically, SHERLOC provides spatial information, telling us where\nsample-specific signals come from. This allows the instrument to determine which\nchemicals are located in the same spot in a rock and thus were likely formed or\ndeposited together.\n\nSHERLOC can sample rocks simply by being held near them. The new results are\nbased on a set of samples from two rock formations found on the floor of the\nJezero crater. In some cases, the imaging was done by pointing it directly at a\nrock; in others, the rock surface, and any dust and contaminants it contained,\nwas abraded away by Perseverance before the imaging was done.\n\nSHERLOC identified a variety of signatures of potential organic material in\nthese samples. There were a few cases where it was technically possible that the\nsignatures were produced by a very specific chemical that lacked carbon\n(primarily cerium salts). But, given the choice between a huge range of organic\nmolecules or a very specific salt, the researchers favor organic materials as\nthe source.\n\nOne thing that was clear was that the level of organic material present changed\nover time. The deeper, older layer called Séítah only had a tenth of the\nmaterial found in the Máaz rocks that formed above them. The reason for this\ndifference isn't clear, but it indicates that either the production or\ndeposition of organic material on Mars has changed over time.\n\n\nREGIONAL DIFFERENCES\n\nBetween the different samples and the ability to resolve different regions of\nthe samples, the researchers were able to identify distinct signals that each\noccurred in many samples. While it wasn't possible to identify the specific\nmolecule responsible, they were able to say a fair bit about them.\n\nOne signal came from samples that contained a ringed organic compound, along\nwith sulfates. The most common signal came from a two-ringed organic molecule\nand was associated with various salts: phosphate, sulfate, silicates, and\npotentially a perchlorate. Another likely contained a benzene ring associated\nwith iron oxides. A different ringed compound was found in two of the samples.\n\nOverall, the researchers conclude that these differences are significant. The\nfact that distinct organic chemicals are consistently associated with different\nsalts suggests that there were either several distinct ways of synthesizing the\norganics or that they were deposited and preserved under distinct conditions.\nMany of the salts seen here are also associated with either water-based\ndeposition or water-driven chemical alteration of the rock—again, consistent\nwith the processes involved changing over time.\n\nCollectively, the researchers say this argues against the organic chemicals\nsimply having been delivered to Mars on a meteorite.\n\nAgain, the instrument can't tell us what the chemicals are, so there's no way to\nknow whether any of the processes involved in creating these deposits involved\nliving things. But that could eventually change since some of the rocks that\nSHERLOC examined have been used to obtain material for the planned Mars sample\nreturn. If that mission ever happens\n[https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/06/the-mars-sample-return-mission-is-starting-to-give-nasa-sticker-shock/],\nthen we'll finally have the chance to isolate and study the chemicals on Earth.\n\nNature, 2023.  DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-06143-z\n[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06143-z] (\n[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06143-z]About DOIs\n[http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1.ars]).\n[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06143-z]"

Not\nCEERS 1019. As the image below shows, it's made up of three bright clumps.\n\"We’re not used to seeing so much structure in images at these distances,” said\nJeyhan Kartaltepe, an astrophysicist at the Rochester Institute of Technology in\nNew York, who worked on the research. The structures might be galaxies merging\ntogether, and stoking the creation of stars. “A galaxy merger could be partly\nresponsible for fueling the activity in this galaxy’s black hole, and that could\nalso lead to increased star formation,\" Kartaltepe added.\n\n- Unusual black hole: \"CEERS 1019 is not only notable for how long ago it\nexisted, but also how relatively little its black hole weighs,\" NASA explains.\nIt weighs 9 million times more than the sun\n[https://mashable.com/article/solar-flares-sun-active-why], which is a lot, but\nnot compared to the giants often found at the center of galaxies in the young\nuniverse, which are 1 billion times (or more!) heavier.

        "content": "Summary: A new study reveals the annulated sea snake has evolved to perceive a\nwider range of colors than its ancestors.\n\nEarly snakes lost their color vision during their adaptation to dim-light\nburrowing lifestyles, but sea snakes, which inhabit brighter marine\nenvironments, regained color vision.\n\nTwo out of four intact copies of the snake’s opsin gene SWS1 evolved a new\nsensitivity to longer wavelengths dominant in ocean habitats, enabling better\ncolor discrimination.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n 1. The annulated sea snake possesses four intact copies of the opsin gene SWS1,\n    two of which have evolved a new sensitivity to longer wavelengths.\n 2. This adaptation potentially enables sea snakes to better distinguish\n    predators, prey, or potential mates against colorful marine backgrounds.\n 3. The re-emergence of color vision in sea snakes contrasts the evolution of\n    opsins in mammals like bats, dolphins, and whales, which experienced further\n    opsin losses adapting to dim-light and aquatic environments.\n\nSource: Oxford University Press USA\n\nA new paper in Genome Biology and Evolution finds that the annulated sea snake,\na species of venomous snake found in ocean waters around Australia and Asia,\nappears to have evolved to see an extended palette of colors after its ancestors\nlost that ability in response to changing environments.\n\nColor vision in animals is primarily determined by genes called visual opsins.\nWhile there have been multiple losses of opsin genes during the evolution of\ntetrapods (the group including amphibians, reptiles, and mammals), the emergence\nof new opsin genes is extremely rare.\n\nThis shows a snake.\n[https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2023/07/sea-snake-color-vision-neurosicnes.jpg]\nEarly snakes had lost two visual opsin genes during their dim-light burrowing\nphase and could only perceive a very limited range of colors. Credit:\nNeuroscience News\n\nBefore this study, the only evolution  of new opsin genes within reptiles\nappeared to have occurred in species of  Helicops, a genus of snake from South\nAmerica.\n\nThis study used published reference genomes to examine visual opsin genes across\nfive ecologically distinct species of elapid snakes.\n\nThe history of elapids, a family of snakes that includes cobras and mambas in\naddition to the annulated sea snake, presents an opportunity to investigate the\nmolecular evolution of vision genes.\n\nEarly snakes had lost two visual opsin genes during their dim-light burrowing\nphase and could only perceive a very limited range of colors.\n\nHowever, some of their descendants now occupy brighter environments; two elapid\nlineages have even moved from terrestrial to marine environments within the last\n25 million years.\n\nResearchers here found that the annulated sea snake possesses four intact copies\nof the opsin gene SWS1. Two of these genes have the ancestral ultraviolet\nsensitivity, and two have evolved a new sensitivity to the longer wavelengths\nthat dominate ocean habitats.\n\nThe study’s authors believe that this sensitivity may provide the snakes with\nbetter color discrimination to distinguish predators, prey and/or potential\nmates against colorful marine backgrounds.\n\nThis is dramatically different from the evolution of opsins in mammals like\nbats, dolphins, and whales during ecological transitions; they experienced\nfurther opsin losses as they adapted to dim-light and aquatic environments.\n\n “The earliest snakes lost much of their ability to see color due to their\ndim-light burrowing lifestyle,” said the paper’s lead author Isaac Rossetto.\n\n“However, their sea snake descendants now occupy brighter and more\nspectrally-complex marine environments. We believe that recent gene duplications\nhave dramatically expanded the range of colors sea snakes can see.\n\n“For reference, us humans have a similarly expanded sensitivity to colors, while\ncats and dogs are partially color-blind much like those early snakes.”\n\n\nABOUT THIS VISUAL NEUROSCIENCE AND GENETICS RESEARCH NEWS\n\nAuthor: Daniel Luzer\n[https://neurosciencenews.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3155505f58545d1f5d444b5443715e44411f525e5c]\nSource: Oxford University Press USA [http://httpsoup.com/]\nContact: Daniel Luzer – Oxford University Press USA\nImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n“Functional Duplication of the Short-Wavelength-Sensitive Opsin in Sea Snakes:\nEvidence for Reexpanded Colour Sensitivity Following Ancestral Regression\n[https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/15/7/evad107/7219516]” by Isaac Rossetto\net al. Genome Biology and Evolution\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbstract\n\nFunctional Duplication of the Short-Wavelength-Sensitive Opsin in Sea Snakes:\nEvidence for Reexpanded Colour Sensitivity Following Ancestral Regression\n\nColor vision is mediated by ancient and spectrally distinct cone opsins. Yet,\nwhile there have been multiple losses of opsin genes during the evolution of\ntetrapods, evidence for opsin gains via functional duplication is extremely\nscarce.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that some secondarily marine elapid snakes have\nacquired expanded “UV–blue” sensitivity via changes at key spectral tuning amino\nacid sites of the Short-Wavelength Opsin 1 (SWS1) gene.\n\nHere, we use elapid reference genomes to show that the molecular origin of this\nadaptation involved repeated, proximal duplications of the SWS1 gene in the\nfully marine Hydrophis cyanocinctus. This species possesses four intact SWS1\ngenes; two of these genes have the ancestral UV sensitivity, and two have a\nderived sensitivity to the longer wavelengths that dominate marine habitats.\n\nWe suggest that this remarkable expansion of the opsin repertoire of sea snakes\nfunctionally compensates for the ancestral losses of two middle-wavelength\nopsins in the earliest (dim-light adapted) snakes. This provides a striking\ncontrast to the evolution of opsins during ecological transitions in mammals.\n\nLike snakes, early mammals lost two cone photopigments; however, lineages such\nas bats and cetaceans underwent further opsin losses during their adaptation to\ndim-light environments."

Tropical ocean water near the equator has been especially\nimpacted. Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and National\nOceanography Center in the U.K. found that the change is likely driven by\nclimate change. \n\n\"To actually see it happening for real is not surprising, but frightening,\" said\nStephanie Dutkiewicz, the study's coauthor and senior research scientist at\nMIT's department of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences and the Center for\nGlobal Change Science. \"And these changes are consistent with man-induced\nchanges to our climate.\"\n\nThe ocean's color is a product of whatever is in the upper layers of the water.\nIt usually appears blue because the ocean acts as a sunlight filter and the\nwater absorbs colors in the red part of the light spectrum, according to\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n[https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceanblue.html#:~:text=The%20ocean%20acts%20like%20a%20sunlight%20filter.&text=The%20ocean%20is%20blue%20because,part%20of%20the%20light%20spectrum.].\nA greener color, which the researchers found, happens when light bounces off of\nmaterials and life in the water. Greener water is largely driven by the presence\nof phytoplankton.\n\nMuch of the change in color is too subtle for the human eye to notice. The\nresearchers used data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\naboard NASA's Aqua satellite — which has been monitoring ocean color for 21\nyears. \n\nResearchers wrote that the change in color over that time \"suggest that the\neffects of climate change are already being felt in surface marine microbial\necosystems.\"\n\nDutkiewicz said that \"changes in color reflect changes in plankton communities,\nthat will impact everything that feeds on plankton.\" \n\n\"It will also change how much the ocean will take up carbon, because different\ntypes of plankton have different abilities to do that,\" she said. \"So, we hope\npeople take this seriously. It's not only models that are predicting these\nchanges will happen. We can now see it happening, and the ocean is changing.\"\n\nThe team of researchers used simulations of how the water would look both with\nand without the addition of greenhouse gasses to determine the role climate\nchange played, study author BB Cael said. The model with greenhouse gasses\nalmost exactly matched what Cael found in his analysis of real-world satellite\ndata.\n\n\"This suggests that the trends we observe are not a random variation in the\nEarth system,\" Cael said. \"This is consistent with anthropogenic climate\nchange.\"\n\nNASA is set to gather additional data on ocean color.

Their findings were presented at the 2023 National\nAstronomy Meeting in Cardiff by co-author Dr. Alex Jenkins of University College\nLondon.\n\nThe team used computer simulations to study the production of gravitational wave\nsignals\n[https://scitechdaily.com/astronomy-astrophysics-101-gravitational-waves/] in\nsimulated universes with different kinds of dark matter\n[https://scitechdaily.com/astronomy-astrophysics-101-dark-matter/]. Their\nfindings show that counting the number of black-hole merging events detected by\nthe next generation of observatories could tell us whether or not dark matter\ninteracts with other particles, giving us new insights into what it is made of.\n\nCosmologists generally regard dark matter as one of the biggest missing pieces\nin our understanding of the cosmos. Despite strong evidence that dark matter\nmakes up 85% of all the matter in the Universe, there is currently no consensus\non its underlying nature. This includes questions such as whether dark matter\nparticles can collide with other particles such as atoms or neutrinos, or\nwhether they pass straight through them unaffected.\n\nA way to test this is by looking at how galaxies form in dense clouds of dark\nmatter called haloes. If dark matter collides with neutrinos, the dark matter\nstructure becomes dispersed, resulting in fewer galaxies being formed. The\nproblem with this method is that any galaxies that go missing are very small and\nvery distant from us, so it’s hard to see whether they are there or not, even\nwith the best telescopes available.\n\nRather than targeting the missing galaxies directly, the authors of this study\npropose using gravitational waves as an indirect measure of their abundance.\nTheir simulations show that in models where dark matter does collide with other\nparticles, there are significantly fewer black-hole mergers in the distant\nuniverse. While this effect is too small to be seen by current gravitational\nwave experiments, it will be a prime target for the next generation of\nobservatories that are currently being planned.\n\nThe authors hope their methods will help stimulate new ideas for using\ngravitational wave data to explore the large-scale structure of the Universe,\nand shine a new light on the mysterious nature of dark matter.\n\nCo-author Dr. Sownak Bose of Durham University said, “Dark matter remains one of\nthe enduring mysteries in our understanding of the Universe. This means it is\nespecially important to continue identifying new ways to explore models of dark\nmatter, combining both existing and new probes to test model predictions to the\nfullest. Gravitational wave astronomy offers a pathway to better understand not\njust dark matter, but the formation and evolution of galaxies more generally.”\n\nMarkus Mosbech of the University of Sydney, another co-author, adds,\n“Gravitational waves offer us a unique opportunity to observe the early\nUniverse, as they pass unhindered through the Universe, and next-generation\ninterferometers will be sensitive enough to detect individual events at huge\ndistances.”\n\nAnother member of the research team, Professor Mairi Sakellariadou of King’s\nCollege London, said, “Third-generation gravitational wave data will offer a\nnovel and independent way to test the current model that describes the evolution\nof our Universe, and shed light to the yet unknown nature of dark matter.”\n\nThe NAM 2023 conference is principally sponsored by the Royal Astronomical\nSociety (RAS), the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and Cardiff\nUniversity."

        "content": "Fire is a potent symbol with deep spiritual roots, from Greek mythology to\nChristianity. In Norse mythology there’s even a bridge of fire\n[https://mythologysource.com/bifrost-bridge-connecting-heaven-earth/] connecting\nrealms, so the gods can commute to Earth to teach people lessons. So it’s not\nentirely shocking that fire burns with the same significance in meditation\ncircles. And, as it turns out, the mesmerizing flames and crackling sounds of\nfire can be particularly useful in helping meditation beginners to reach a\nserene state.\n\nWhy does staring into fire help us chill out? The answer is “rooted in our human\nhistory and biology,” says Ryan Sultan, M.D.\n[https://www.integrativepsych.nyc/experts/dr-ryan-sultan], a psychiatrist,\ndirector of the New York City-based private practice Integrative Psych\n[http://www.integrativepsych.nyc/], and a research professor at Columbia\nUniversity [https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/ryan-s-sultan-md] who\nstudies meditation. Since humans have gathered around fires for hundreds of\nthousands of years, there’s an innate association with relaxation, safety, and\ncalm that comes with fire, Sultan says. When people meditate, the goal is\nsimilarly to activate the parasympathetic nervous system and override\nfight-or-flight mode.\n\nSo, for parents who want to try a different approach to meditation, “Watching a\nfire can act as a sort of cheat code for achieving this state, as our minds\nnaturally find it soothing and mesmerizing,” Sultan says.\n\nThough some forms of meditation call on practitioners to close their eyes,\nSultan recommends keeping your eyes open during fire mediation, in order to\nfocus your attention: “Notice the colors, the movement, the heat, and the\nsounds. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the fire.”\n\nFocusing on your senses noticing the environment is central to many mindfulness\nexercises, such as the grounding method\n[https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/grounding-method-explainer], and simply\nnaming the things we can see, smell, taste, or touch can help us manage anxiety\n[https://www.fatherly.com/health/high-functioning-anxiety-signs].\n\nFrom free fire meditations on YouTube to bonfires in the backyard, I tried to\ntorch my resistance to meditation and learn a little bit more about this classic\nmindfulness [https://www.fatherly.com/health/mindfulness-exercises] hack. And\nalthough this meditation technique might sound campy (or campfire-y?), it proved\nsurprisingly helpful in bringing on the calm.\n\n\nFIRETUBE\n\nIt might seem silly to watch a video of a fire for meditation purposes, but tell\nthat to all the people who watch a yule log burn on TV every Christmas.\n\nWhen I tried a “fire meditation for awakening the solar plexus chakra” on\nYouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKrdC_iMfNU], it was less guided than\nthe basic YouTube meditations I had tried before\n[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=meditation+for+beginners]. And at\nfirst, the idea of an hour-long video of a fire was daunting. But once I got\nstarted, I found my attempts to meditate easier and more open-ended, even if I\ndidn’t quite make it to the end of the video.\n\nAlthough experiencing fire in real life is optimal, the sound of crackling can\nbe “very calming in itself,” Sultan says. To his point, the sounds felt like the\nmost calming part of the experience, and I was able to close my eyes and let the\ncrackles and pops calm me accordingly.\n\nIn the future, I would mostly lean on the audio alone, and visualize fire with\nmy eyes closed, instead of increasing my screen time\n[https://www.fatherly.com/health/screen-time-hurts-kids-dopamine-addiction].\n\n\nCANDLE-GAZING\n\nIf scented candles brighten your mood, there might be a good reason — gazing at\ncandles is actually an established meditation technique known as “trataka.” And\nalthough it might seem like an excuse to make your house smell like a spa,\nstudies [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8039332/] show that this\nform of meditation can boost cognition. Other research\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2225411014000443] indicates\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975664/] that meditating while concentrating\non a candle might increase a person’s attention and memory, and these effects\nseem to be stronger for older adults\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25035618/].\n\nFor meditation purposes, I found that I prefer candles with a wooden wick, which\nprovide a comparable soothing crackle to a burning log. You can also pair an\naudio-only fire meditation with focusing on a candle, so you get both the visual\nfocal point and the soothing sounds.\n\n\nA REAL SCORCHER\n\nTo experience fire meditation fully, you can use a fireplace or a backyard fire\npit. Given that nature exposure has been linked\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8125471/] with improved cognition\nand mental health, I went with the outdoor option, via a friend’s backyard.\n\nAs my friend chased around her 2-year-old son and their two dogs, the crackling\nsound of the fire drowned them out, and I started to relax. After a few minutes\nof clearing my head and recycling some breathwork\n[https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/five-breathing-exercises-that-will-help-you-conquer-coronavirus-anxiety]\nand mantras [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4S4twjeWTs&t=307s] I’ve picked up\nfrom guided meditations and yoga classes over the years, I understood why my dad\nwould always study the lit-up fireplace. He was falling effortlessly — even\nunintentionally — into a meditation.\n\nAfter meditating, I joined my friend’s family for burgers on the deck and\nproceeded to have a lovely evening. As much as I’d like to think I was even more\npresent for our dinner, I was already having a good night. That’s the catch with\nfire meditation — it’s not a tool you can easily call on when you’re having a\nbad day, and the best scenarios for the practice tend to be when everything is\ngoing pretty well already.\n\nI suspect a lot of why I enjoyed this fire meditation in particular had to do\nwith meditating outside and in the company of others, something I’d tried only a\nfew times over the years, once with a community meditation group that met in\nHerbert Von King Park in Brooklyn. Being outside and with other people made all\nthe difference — and a growing number of communities are starting to offer\nfamily-friendly\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=family+friendly+meditation+groups+near+me&sxsrf=AB5stBj6CbDy43D-GMD_1xYt2Lmx3cvEfg%3A1689112952106&ei=eNGtZNCHBqGo5NoPw7q1kA0&ved=0ahUKEwjQo_uL1IeAAxUhFFkFHUNdDdIQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=family+friendly+meditation+groups+near+me&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQogQyBQgAEKIEOgcIABANEIAEOgYIABAHEB46CAgAEAUQHhANOgoIIRCgARDDBBAKOggIIRCgARDDBEoECEEYAFAAWO4RYIwUaABwAXgAgAF0iAHqC5IBBDExLjWYAQCgAQHAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp]\nmeditation circles. Although I won’t insist on others meditating with me at my\nnext social bonfire, I will take a few quiet moments to myself and focus on the\nsight and sound of fire.\n\nOverall, I found it easier to connect to fire meditation than other forms of\nmeditation I’ve tried over the years, from apps like Headspace to in-person yoga\n[https://www.fatherly.com/health/yoga-poses-that-make-you-poop] classes.\n\n\nIS FIRE MEDITATION SAFE?\n\nA few weeks after I hacked meditation with fire, Chicago’s air quality\n[https://www.chicagotribune.com/weather/ct-air-quality-alert-high-risk-swimming-20230627-kbv6oh3w4jcgjadfd37iwacbp4-story.html]\ndeclined to the worst in the world due to the smoke from recent Canadian\nwildfires. I began to wonder if, for the sake of my lungs, meditating with fire\nwas like a lot of other things that people did hundreds of thousands of years\nago — something modern humans should stop doing because it’s a bad idea.\n\nOn an individual level, there are precautions people can take, like keeping the\nfire in a controlled environment such as a pit or fireplace (which you were\nalready going to be doing with kids around), as well as using untreated wood or\nmanufactured logs that are ethically sourced.\n\nAnd, for your health, the Cleveland Clinic\n[https://health.clevelandclinic.org/fire-pits-bonfires-and-your-lungs-7-safety-tips/#:~:text=Your%20lungs%20can't%20take%20the%20heat&text=The%20heat%20itself%20is%20harmful,smoke%20inhalation%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Dr.]\nalso cautions fire-gazers to keep a distance, because heat itself can damage\nyour lungs.

For cognitive abilities to\nevolve, performance must be linked to individual fitness benefits, but these\nlinks have been rarely studied in primates even though they exceed most other\nmammals in these traits.\n\nWe subjected 198 wild gray mouse lemurs to four cognitive and two personality\ntests and subsequently monitored their survival in a mark-recapture study.\n\nOur study revealed that survival was predicted by individual variation in\ncognitive performance as well as body mass and exploration.\n\nBecause cognitive performance covaried negatively with exploration, individuals\ngathering more accurate information enjoyed better cognitive performance and\nlived longer, but so did heavier and more explorative individuals.\n\nThese effects may reflect a speed-accuracy trade-off, with alternative\nstrategies yielding similar overall fitness.\n\nThe observed intraspecific variation in selective benefits of cognitive\nperformance, if heritable, can provide the basis for the evolution of cognitive\nabilities in members of our lineage."

        "content": "Biology is a wondrous yet delicate tapestry. At the heart is DNA, the master\nweaver that encodes proteins, responsible for orchestrating the many biological\nfunctions that sustain life within the human body. However, our body is akin to\na finely tuned instrument, susceptible to losing its harmony. After all, we’re\nfaced with an ever-changing and relentless natural world: pathogens, viruses,\ndiseases, and cancer. \n\nImagine if we could expedite the process of creating vaccines or drugs for newly\nemerged pathogens. What if we had gene editing technology capable of\nautomatically producing proteins to rectify DNA errors that cause cancer? The\nquest to identify proteins that can strongly bind to targets or speed up\nchemical reactions is vital for drug development, diagnostics, and numerous\nindustrial applications, yet it is often a protracted and costly endeavor.\n\nTo advance our capabilities in protein engineering, MIT CSAIL researchers came\nup with “FrameDiff,” a computational tool for creating new protein structures\nbeyond what nature has produced. The machine learning approach generates\n“frames” that align with the inherent properties of protein structures, enabling\nit to construct novel proteins independently of preexisting designs,\nfacilitating unprecedented protein structures.\n\n\"In nature, protein design is a slow-burning process that takes millions of\nyears. Our technique aims to provide an answer to tackling human-made problems\nthat evolve much faster than nature's pace,” says MIT CSAIL PhD student Jason\nYim, a lead author on a new paper about the work. “The aim, with respect to this\nnew capacity of generating synthetic protein structures, opens up a myriad of\nenhanced capabilities, such as better binders. This means engineering proteins\nthat can attach to other molecules more efficiently and selectively, with\nwidespread implications related to targeted drug delivery and biotechnology,\nwhere it could result in the development of better biosensors. It could also\nhave implications for the field of biomedicine and beyond, offering\npossibilities such as developing more efficient photosynthesis proteins,\ncreating more effective antibodies, and engineering nanoparticles for gene\ntherapy.” \n\nFraming FrameDiff\n\nProteins have complex structures, made up of many atoms connected by chemical\nbonds. The most important atoms that determine the protein’s 3D shape are called\nthe “backbone,” kind of like the spine of the protein. Every triplet of atoms\nalong the backbone shares the same pattern of bonds and atom types. Researchers\nnoticed this pattern can be exploited to build machine learning algorithms using\nideas from differential geometry and probability. This is where the frames come\nin: Mathematically, these triplets can be modeled as rigid bodies called\n“frames” (common in physics) that have a position and rotation in 3D. \n\nThese frames equip each triplet with enough information to know about its\nspatial surroundings. The task is then for a machine learning algorithm to learn\nhow to move each frame to construct a protein backbone. By learning to construct\nexisting proteins, the algorithm hopefully will generalize and be able to create\nnew proteins never seen before in nature.\n\nTraining a model to construct proteins via “diffusion” involves injecting noise\nthat randomly moves all the frames and blurs what the original protein looked\nlike. The algorithm’s job is to move and rotate each frame until it looks like\nthe original protein. Though simple, the development of diffusion on frames\nrequires techniques in stochastic calculus on Riemannian manifolds. On the\ntheory side, the researchers developed “SE(3) diffusion” for learning\nprobability distributions that nontrivially connects the translations and\nrotations components of each frame.\n\n3D animation of a protein structure being generated from a bundle of purple dots\n[https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__image_gallery/public/images/202307/MIT-News-FrameDiff%20%28003%29.gif?itok=vQ1wBPV_]\n\nGeneration of a protein structure with FrameDiff\n\nImage: Ian Haydon/Institute for Protein Design\n\nThe subtle art of diffusion\n\nIn 2021, DeepMind introduced AlphaFold2, a deep learning algorithm for\npredicting 3D protein structures from their sequences. When creating synthetic\nproteins, there are two essential steps: generation and prediction. Generation\nmeans the creation of new protein structures and sequences, while \"prediction\"\nmeans figuring out what the 3D structure of a sequence is. It’s no coincidence\nthat AlphaFold2 also used frames to model proteins. SE(3) diffusion and\nFrameDiff were inspired to take the idea of frames further by incorporating\nframes into diffusion models, a generative AI technique that has become\nimmensely popular in image generation, like Midjourney, for example. \n\nThe shared frames and principles between protein structure generation and\nprediction meant the best models from both ends were compatible. In\ncollaboration with the Institute for Protein Design at the University of\nWashington, SE(3) diffusion is already being used to create and experimentally\nvalidate novel proteins. Specifically, they combined SE(3) diffusion with\nRosettaFold2, a protein structure prediction tool much like AlphaFold2, which\nled to “RFdiffusion.” This new tool brought protein designers closer to solving\ncrucial problems in biotechnology, including the development of highly specific\nprotein binders for accelerated vaccine design, engineering of symmetric\nproteins for gene delivery, and robust motif scaffolding for precise enzyme\ndesign. \n\nFuture endeavors for FrameDiff involve improving generality to problems that\ncombine multiple requirements for biologics such as drugs. Another extension is\nto generalize the models to all biological modalities including DNA and small\nmolecules. The team posits that by expanding FrameDiff's training on more\nsubstantial data and enhancing its optimization process, it could generate\nfoundational structures boasting design capabilities on par with RFdiffusion,\nall while preserving the inherent simplicity of FrameDiff. \n\n“Discarding a pretrained structure prediction model [in FrameDiff] opens up\npossibilities for rapidly generating structures extending to large lengths,”\nsays Harvard University computational biologist Sergey Ovchinnikov. The\nresearchers' innovative approach offers a promising step toward overcoming the\nlimitations of current structure prediction models. Even though it's still\npreliminary work, it's an encouraging stride in the right direction. As such,\nthe vision of protein design, playing a pivotal role in addressing humanity's\nmost pressing challenges, seems increasingly within reach, thanks to the\npioneering work of this MIT research team.” \n\nYim wrote the paper alongside Columbia University postdoc Brian Trippe, French\nNational Center for Scientific Research in Paris' Center for Science of Data\nresearcher Valentin De Bortoli, Cambridge University postdoc Emile Mathieu, and\nOxford University professor of statistics and senior research scientist at\nDeepMind Arnaud Doucet. MIT professors Regina Barzilay and Tommi Jaakkola\nadvised the research. \n\nThe team's work was supported, in part, by the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for\nMachine Learning in Health, EPSRC grants and a Prosperity Partnership between\nMicrosoft Research and Cambridge University, the National Science Foundation\nGraduate Research Fellowship Program, NSF Expeditions grant, Machine Learning\nfor Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis consortium, the DTRA Discovery of\nMedical Countermeasures Against New and Emerging threats program, the DARPA\nAccelerated Molecular Discovery program, and the Sanofi Computational Antibody\nDesign grant. This research will be presented at the International Conference on\nMachine Learning in July."

The\nPleiades, shaped like a tiny dipper, are also called the Seven Sisters or\nMessier 45 (M45\n[https://earthsky.org/clusters-nebulae-galaxies/what-are-messier-objects/]).\nThey’re a true family of stars, born together and still moving together through\nspace as a family. And they are fabulous to view in binoculars!\n\nAlso nearby, you’ll find a bright red star. It’s Aldebaran\n[https://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/aldebaran-is-taurus-bloodshot-eye/], the\nfiery eye of Taurus\n[https://earthsky.org/constellations/taurus-heres-your-constellation] the Bull.\nAldebaran is one of our sky’s brightest stars. It’s part of a V-shaped cluster\nof stars – the Hyades\n[https://earthsky.org/favorite-star-patterns/v-shaped-hyades-star-cluster-easy-to-find]\n– that forms the Bull’s face. In dark enough skies, the Hyades should be easy to\nspot.\n\nBy the way, although Aldebaran appears among them, it is not actually a member\nof the Hyades star cluster. The fact is, it’s actually much closer to us in\nspace than the other stars of the Hyades cluster.\n\n\nWHEN CAN YOU SEE THEM?\n\nThe moon and Taurus will ascend above the eastern horizon shortly after 2 a.m.\n(your local time). So look for them in the dark morning sky before the sky\nstarts to lighten, announcing the arrival of the morning sun.\n\nSince the view of the stars, moon and planets varies by your position on the\nglobe, we suggest you try Stellarium [https://stellarium-web.org/] for a precise\nstar chart for your location.\n\n\nTHE MYSTERY OF THE ‘LOST’ STAR\n\nThe Pleiades is also known as the Seven Sisters. Yet, many people can only see\nsix stars with their eyes alone. How many stars do you see? Some keen-eyed\nobservers have reported seeing 11 stars. Of course, you’ll need dark skies\n[https://earthsky.org/stargazing/] to see some of the dimmer stars.\n\nThrough binoculars, those six stars suddenly become 30 to 70 stars. And\nbinoculars are ideal\n[https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/best-targets-for-binoculars-moon-planets-nebula-clusters/]\nfor looking at the Pleiades. The cluster is so wide that they spill out of a\ntelescope’s field of view. Regardless of how many stars you see, the Pleiades is\na popular pattern of stars and worth the effort to get up early on a summer\nmorning to catch them and the moon.\n\nBottom line: Watch for the moon near the Pleiades – a beautiful open star\ncluster – on the mornings of July 13 and 14, 2023. Nearby you’ll find the bright\nstar Aldebaran.\n\nFor more great observing events in the coming weeks, visit EarthSky’s night sky\nguide\n[https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/visible-planets-tonight-mars-jupiter-venus-saturn-mercury/]\n\nFor more videos of great night sky events, visit EarthSky’s YouTube page\n[https://www.youtube.com/@earthsky].\n\nMARCY CURRAN\n\nView Articles [https://earthsky.org/author/marcy/]\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\n\nMarcy Curran has enjoyed star gazing since she was a young girl going on family\ncamping trips under the dark skies of Wyoming.

Cuprates are the only unconventional superconducting family that\nhost bulk superconductivity with Tcs above the liquid nitrogen boiling\ntemperature at 77 K. Here we observe signatures of superconductivity in single\ncrystals of La3Ni2O7 with a maximum Tc of 80 K at pressures between\n\\(14.0-43.5\\) GPa from high-pressure resistance and mutual inductive magnetic\nsusceptibility measurements. The superconducting phase under high pressure\nexhibits an orthorhombic structure of Fmmm space group with the\n3\\({d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}}\\) and 3\\({d}_{{z}^{2}}\\) orbitals of Ni cations\nstrongly mixing with oxygen 2p orbitals. Our density functional theory\ncalculations suggest the superconductivity emerges coincidently with the\nmetallization of the σ-bonding bands under the Fermi level, consisting of the\n3\\({d}_{{z}^{2}}\\) orbitals with the apical oxygens connecting Ni-O bilayers.\nThus, our discoveries not only reveal important clues for the high-Tc\nsuperconductivity in this Ruddlesden-Popper double-layered perovskite nickelates\nbut also provide a new family of compounds to investigate the high-Tc\nsuperconductivity mechanism.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\n[https://wayf.springernature.com/?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06408-7]\n\n\nACCESS OPTIONS\n\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n\n$29.99 / 30 days\n\ncancel any time\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\nReceive 51 print issues and online access\n\n$199.00 per year\n\nonly $3.90 per issue\n\nRent or buy this article\n\nPrices vary by article type\n\nfrom$1.95\n\nto$39.95\n\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\n\n\nADDITIONAL ACCESS OPTIONS:\n\n * Log in\n   [https://idp.nature.com/authorize/natureuser?client_id=grover&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06408-7]\n * Learn about institutional subscriptions\n   [https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/license-options]\n * Read our FAQs [https://support.nature.com/en/support/home]\n * Contact customer support [https://www.springernature.com/gp/contact]\n\n\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\n\nAuthor notes\n\n 1.

A local ranger guided them\nthrough Pan de Azúcar, a roughly 150-square-mile national park on the southern\ncoast of the Atacama Desert, which is often described as the driest place on\nEarth. They found themselves in a flat, gravelly wasteland interrupted by\noccasional hills, where hairy cacti reached their arms toward a sky that never\nrained. The ground under their feet formed a checkerboard, with irregular\npatches of dark pebbles sitting between lighter ones as bleached as bone.\n\nInitially, the black patches speckling the desert surface didn’t interest group\nleader Burkhard Büdel [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Burkhard-Buedel], a\nveteran biologist who had spent the last several decades scraping deserts on all\nseven continents for signs of life. Discolorations like these, known as desert\nvarnish, are ubiquitous and routinely signify deposits of manganese or other\nminerals. Keep moving, he instructed his teammates.\n\nBut his graduate student Patrick Jung\n[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick-Jung-7] couldn’t get the\ncheckerboard out of his head. Having spotted what looked like lichens on some of\nthe dark pebbles, Jung suspected that something more might inhabit them.\nEventually, he picked up a rock, dribbled some water on it from a bottle, and\npeered at it through his handheld magnifying lens. The face of the black stone\nerupted with green. The rubble had come alive.\n\nJung whipped a photosynthesis monitor out of his pack. One tap of its\nfluorescent blue sensor confirmed that something within the rocks was converting\ncarbon dioxide to oxygen. After Jung’s colleagues, Büdel included, replicated\nthe experiment, they all danced with excitement under the desert sun. Then they\nlay down on their bellies, eyes fixed on the microbial carpet living in the\ndust. All around them, the dark patches repeated across the landscape, each one\nfilled with its own microscopic universe.\n\nSince 2019, Jung has led a project at the University of Applied Sciences in\nKaiserslautern, Germany, dedicated to the study of the unusual community of\nmicrobes [https://doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12368], now known as grit crust. His team\nhas worked to understand the extreme adaptations that have allowed these\nmicroorganisms to inhabit a land so infamously hostile, where they are refreshed\nonly occasionally by sips of fog. The answers they have uncovered\n[https://doi.org/10.3389/fspas.2022.1052278] offer clues about how life may have\nfirst found a grip on our planet’s surface billions of years ago.\n\nTwo months ago, the park ranger who first brought the German scientists to Pan\nde Azúcar guided me to the site of their discovery. Kneeling in one of the\ncheckerboard’s black spaces, José Luis Gutiérrez Alvarado picked up a stone\nabout the size of an earring stud. From his pocket he retrieved a magnifying\njeweler’s loupe, a personal keepsake inscribed with the words “Los secretos de\nlas rocas.” He held the loupe over the stone in his palm so that I could learn\nits secrets too.\n\nThe discovery of the grit crust transformed the desert for Gutiérrez Alvarado,\nwho has patrolled it every day for the last decade. “It’s not only rocks, not\nonly empty space,” he said, peering out over the patches of pebbles. “Everything\nis breathing now.”\n\nA grid of photos: the researcher Liesbeth van den Brink and the park ranger José\nLuis Gutiérrez Alvarado crouching on the desert floor; an open palm holding two\ntiny dark pebbles; a magnified view of the pebbles through a jeweler’s loupe;\nand desert rocks covered with green, black and yellow microbial growth.\n[https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2023/07/Quadriptych-byZachSavitsky-scaled.webp]\n\nThe researcher Liesbeth van den Brink and the park ranger José Luis Gutiérrez\nAlvarado examine the “grit crust” microorganisms that inhabit pebbles on the\ndesert floor. A jeweler’s loupe that Gutiérrez Alvarado carries provides\nmagnification.\n\nZack Savitsky for Quanta Magazine\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nTHE PLANET’S LIVING SKIN\n\nDriving through Pan de Azúcar with Gutiérrez Alvarado is like riding in a\ngeological time machine. Ancient volcanic caverns from one epoch fade to rolling\nhills of eroded sand from another, and beyond them sits an occasional grassy\nquarry or cactus grove.\n\nBetween the hills peeks an outcropping of the mother bedrock, a heap of quartz\nspiced with different minerals. At its feet lie its progeny, smaller chunks that\nhave broken off over millions of years. Below them sits a parade of\nprogressively smaller rocks, all the way down to the earring-size grains that\nfirst captivated Jung. The pebbles, which litter the desert floor, are known\nlocally as “maicillo” and in English as “grit.” The substrate is amply porous,\noffering plenty of cracks and corners for microbes to nuzzle into. Wedged into\nthe crevices of each grade of rock are tiny thickets of green and black life.\n\nDuring the 2017 expedition, Jung collected and dried samples of this grit and\nshipped them back to Germany. Then he threw himself into learning more about the\nmicrobes with such determination that he finished his doctorate in just two and\na half years, with over 10 publications to show for it. From DNA samples, he\ndeduced that the grit crust is composed of several hundred species of\ncyanobacteria, green algae and fungi — including several previously unknown\nlichen combinations. Meanwhile, his colleagues sliced the stones thin for\nimaging. The photos showed how individual fungal hyphae had drilled deep into\nthe rocks, carving out networks of branching canals.\n\nPatrick Jung standing inside a desert rock formation sculpted by weathering.\n[https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2023/07/PatrickJung-CourtesyofPatrickJung-1.webp]\n\nPatrick Jung, a researcher now at the University of Applied Sciences in\nKaiserslautern, Germany, discovered the grit crust community in Pan de Azúcar in\n2017.\n\nCourtesy of Patrick Jung\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAt first glance, the grit crust could seem like a routine example of what\nresearchers call a biological soil crust, or “biocrust” — a community of\ncoexisting bacteria, fungi, algae and other microorganisms that caps the soil in\ncoherent sheets. Around 12% of Earth’s land is covered by biocrusts. Ecologists\noften refer to these colonies as the planet’s “living skin.”\n\nOver the last century, scientists have identified biocrusts around the globe and\nworked to understand their role in shaping ecosystems. They’ve learned that the\ncrusts anchor soil grains in place and provide the organisms growing in that\nsoil with essential nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. In 2012,\nBüdel and his colleagues estimated [https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1486]\nthat biocrusts soak up and recycle around 7% of all the carbon and nearly half\nof all the nitrogen that is chemically “fixed” by terrestrial vegetation. The\nrole of the biocrusts in procuring digestible nitrogen is particularly critical\nin arid deserts: Elsewhere, lightning can often convert atmospheric nitrogen to\nnitrates, but in the deserts, electrical storms are rare.\n\nThe biocrust creates “little oases of fertility,” said Jayne Belnap\n[https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/jayne-belnap], an ecologist at the U.S.\nGeological Survey who helped to standardize the term “biocrust” in 2001. “That\narea is going to be [like] popsicles for the soil organisms. They’re sugar\naddicts just like all the rest of us.”\n\nBut the microbial community in Pan de Azúcar isn’t just any old biocrust. While\ntraditional biocrusts drape themselves over the top layer of fine soil\nparticles, and other kinds of organisms sprout directly on top of individual\nboulders, “the grit is in between — it’s a transition zone,” said Liesbeth van\nden Brink\n[https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/biologie/institute/evolution-und-oekologie/lehrbereiche/vegetationsoekologie/mitarbeiterinnen/liesbeth-van-den-brink/],\nan ecology researcher at the University of Tübingen who now lives just outside\nPan de Azúcar with Gutiérrez Alvarado. In grit crust, the stones provide the\nstructure, but the microbes colonize them in a coherent sheet — like a thin\nlayer of resin grouting together a rock garden.\n\nBecause the organisms are so intimately associated with the rocky substrate, the\ngrit crusts embody “the collision of the abiotic with the biotic,” said Rómulo\nOses\n[http://www.cridesat.uda.cl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=426:romulo-oses-pedraza&catid=41:equipo-cridesat],\na biologist at the University of Atacama. “At this interface, you will see a lot\nof answers.”\n\nThe grit crusts of Pan de Azúcar have compelled scientists to expand their\nconception [https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12862] of what biocrusts are, where\nmicrobes can survive, and how microbial communities shape the environment around\nthem. They are opening the door for reconsiderations of how Earth and life\ncoevolved over epochs.\n\nCacti growing in the desert, surrounded by fog and covered with shaggy lichenous\ngrowths.\n[https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2023/07/DesertFog-byZachSavitsky-scaled.webp]\n\nIn the park, various species of cactus are nourished by a fog that regularly\nseeps in from the coast.\n\nZack Savitsky for Quanta Magazine\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nSIPPING ON FOG\n\nPan de Azúcar is desolate, but it’s far from lifeless. Bordering the Pacific\nOcean near sea level, the park is much more temperate than the Atacama’s\nelevated hyper-arid core. Still, it receives at most 12 millimeters of rain per\nyear, and the solar radiation levels are often blisteringly high.\n\nOn the way to the park’s sole food truck, where Gutiérrez Alvarado, van den\nBrink and I can stop for a local seafood empanada, we take a detour. Gutiérrez\nAlvarado stops to check on one of his weather-monitoring devices, which is\nenclosed in barbed wire and fastened down with rocks in the desert. Next to it,\nhe points out a roughly cow-size depression in the ground where a guanaco, a\nwild relative of the llama, recently took a dust bath. Gutiérrez Alvarado and\nthe other rangers recently counted 83 guanacos living in the park.\n\n“How do they survive here?” van den Brink marveled. “How does anything survive\nhere?”\n\nThe answer is the distinctive thick fog that rolls up the Chilean coastline, a\nweather phenomenon known locally as the camanchaca. With so little rainfall, all\nlife in Pan de Azúcar ultimately depends on whatever moisture the fog carries.\nThe guanaco, for example, relies on sips of water that is trapped by mosses\nclinging to cacti, which grow in soil fertilized by grit crust.\n\nThe humans in the park are no different. On a ridge overlooking the coast sit\nfour mesh panels the size of garage doors, which Gutiérrez Alvarado and the\nother rangers set up as fog collectors. Enough water condenses on them every day\nto supply a sink at one of the park’s few toilets. The fog is so thick that it\nonce nearly caused Gutiérrez Alvarado to drive straight off a cliff face into\nthe ocean; only a tiny sign on the ground reminded him to turn left at the last\nmoment.\n\nFour large mesh panels set atop a foggy hill.\n[https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2023/07/FogTraps-byZachSavitsky.webp]\n\nA series of mesh panels catches the dense desert fog known as camanchaca. Runoff\nfrom the panels supplies water to a public sink.\n\nZack Savitsky for Quanta Magazine\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMost of that water, however, is out of reach for the grit crust organisms. For\nmuch of the day, the stones get so hot that a boundary layer of roastingly hot\nair forms over them, preventing the microbes from soaking up the moisture. The\nmicroorganisms have learned to wait out the heat of the day in a dehydrated,\ndormant state. But at night, there’s no sunlight for them to use for\nphotosynthesis. So the microbes have at most a few hours after sunrise to drink\nthe water that has condensed as fog or dew.\n\nJung and colleagues tested just how little water the microbes need to start\nphotosynthesizing. The ideal serving was 0.25 millimeters of water — lower than\nthe requirement of any other known biocrust. Once dampened, the microbes start\nphotosynthesizing faster than any community the researchers have ever seen.\n\n“There is a way for these organisms to live long and prosper despite the fact\nthat they’re in a hyper-arid area,” Belnap said. That resourcefulness hugely\nextends the terrain that biocrusts can occupy beyond what scientists had\nthought. Although grit crust has been found only in Pan de Azúcar so far,\nresearchers suspect it may also grow in other regions of the Atacama and\npossibly in the deserts of southern Africa.\n\n“The grit crust is setting a new threshold for conditions that make life\npossible,” Jung said.\n\nYet just as the desert has conditioned these microbes, the microbes literally\nshape the desert. Because of all the organisms colonizing the tiny rocks, when\nthe grit crusts get wet and the cells rehydrate themselves, the volume of each\ngrit stone increases by around 25%. As the desert fog rolls in and out, the grit\nstones swell and shrink. These regular contractions, along with the acids\nsecreted by the microbes during photosynthesis, have a “biological weathering”\neffect — breaking rocks down to pebbles, and from pebbles to grit.\n\nAt top, researcher Liesbeth van den Brink squats beside a cactus covered with\nshaggy lichens. At bottom, a drop of moisture is caught in the lichens.\n[https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2023/07/Diptych-byZachSavitsky-scaled.webp]\n\nVan den Brink points out cactus lichens, which trap droplets of fog water that\nare sipped by the park’s wildlife.\n\nZack Savitsky for Quanta Magazine\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWhile all biocrusts perform some degree of weathering, the larger grains of the\ngrit crust are especially suited for it. The process reveals the full potential\nof microbes to impact their environment. A microbial skin can glue together\npebbles, break them down into soil and fertilize that soil with essential\nnutrients. In effect, the crust can “terraform” the desert.\n\nThe power of the microbes was on full display after a disaster in 2015. Two\nyears before Jung set foot in Pan de Azúcar, a rare flash flood ravaged the\narea. In just two days, the region received many years’ worth of rain. The\nresulting floods caused at least 31 deaths in neighboring towns.\n\nThe desert, however, burst with life. Over the following months, the dirt gave\nrise to a miraculous display of wildflowers — a “desierto florido.” How the\nplants awakened from a decades-long rest with such zest has perplexed soil\nbiologists. But again, the key may be in the crust.\n\nFernando D. Alfaro\n[https://gema.umayor.cl/eng/about-us/researchers/fernando-alfaro], a microbial\necologist at Major University in Chile, tests that hypothesis by unleashing his\nown tiny floods upon the desert. He pours gallons of bottled water onto\nsquare-meter plots of desert soil. The plots that are covered in biocrust retain\nwater for much longer, and some have managed to sprout plants in just a few\nweeks.\n\n“For many years, [biocrusts] are preparing the system and the substrate to\nrespond very fast to this input of rains,” Alfaro said. “These flower events\ndepend on these tiny communities of microbes.”\n\nJung, too, has witnessed the microbes’ resilience. At 11 sites around Pan de\nAzúcar, he selected neighboring black and white splotches and measured their\nbiological activity. Then he collected the top layer of grit, sterilized it in a\npressure cooker, and placed it back on the ground. Within a year, the once-black\nareas became dark again as the microorganisms started recolonizing the sterile\nplots — far more quickly than usually occurs with the lichens and other microbes\nin biocrusts. Remote sensing data taken during the past decade has shown that\n89% of the park’s surface is covered in the checkerboard pattern. Within that\ncolonized area, about a quarter of the black-and-white design shifted over the\nlast eight years — a surprisingly quick reaction time for the usually sluggish\nmicrobes.\n\n\nTINY CONQUERORS OF THE LAND\n\nThe grit crust plays an important role in the local ecosystem, but its\nscientific allure doesn’t stop there. Ancient, stable and unearthly, this\nenvironment also draws the attention of astrobiologists.\n\nFor decades, scientists have used sections of the Atacama Desert as terrestrial\nanalogues [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2021.810426/full]\nfor Mars. The extreme radiation, infrequent precipitation, barren landscape and\nwild temperature fluctuations make the desert distinctively otherworldly.\n(Gutiérrez Alvarado, however, maintains that the most alien thing about Pan de\nAzúcar are his fellow park rangers — “definitely they are Martians,” he said,\ncracking a smile.)\n\nResearchers are using Atacama biocrusts to construct a library of chemical\nsignatures that could guide the search for microbial life on Mars. But the\nbiocrust organisms also open a window into life on a slightly less foreign\nplanet: the early Earth.\n\nFossil evidence [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8279515/] suggests\nthat microbes were living near deep-sea hydrothermal vents around 3.5 billion\nyears ago. When and how life conquered the land, however, is less clear. The\nterrain on the continents was harder, sharper and far more forbidding than it is\ntoday.\n\n“You wouldn’t have had nicely developed soil like you do now,” said Ariel Anbar,\na geochemist at Arizona State University. “Plants that depend on there having\nbeen many generations of plants before to create an environment that’s\nhospitable — they would have had a tough time.”\n\nDesert floor of Pan de Azúcar, showing the irregular patches of dark pebbles\namid lighter ones.\n[https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2023/07/Desert-byZachSavitsky-scaled.webp]\n\nPebbles filled with grit crust microbes form a patchy black layer that covers\nmuch of the ground in Pan de Azúcar.\n\nZack Savitsky for Quanta Magazine\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBefore plants arrived, some researchers think, crusts of microbes could have\nhelped prepare the land by transforming bare rock into fertilized soil. A\nbiocrust well adapted to extreme conditions could take hold of a suitable\nsubstrate that held nutrients and was regularly moistened with fog. By gradually\nweathering the rocks and stabilizing the sediment as soil, it could alter the\nenvironment in a way that promoted the development of higher organisms.\n\n“This biocrust of Pan de Azúcar represents this scenario,” Alfaro said. “It is\nlike a primordial community to increase the development of soils and make more\ncomplex communities.”\n\nThe grit crust microbes in the Atacama today aren’t a perfect replica of the\nones that may have prepared the early Earth. Such an ancient community likely\nwould have been tuned for an oxygen-deficient environment and devoid of lichens,\nwhich are thought to have evolved only in the last 250 million years. But the\nresearchers agree that modern grit crust communities can still serve as valuable\nanalogues for what came eons before.\n\nThe idea that microbes could have primed the habitability of early Earth is not\na new one. In the 1980s, the environmental scientists David Schwartzman at\nHoward University and Tyler Volk at New York University suggested that the\nbiological weathering [https://doi.org/10.1038/340457a0] caused by early land\nlife could have sequestered enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to cool\nthe Earth’s surface into a range habitable for other creatures. “We have\nevidence of really intense weathering in the Archean,” Schwartzman said.\n“Presumably biocrusts played some role in that.”\n\nBut we don’t have to rely on assumptions. Over the past few decades, indirect\nevidence has surfaced for microbial communities on land during the Archean.\nGregory Retallack, an emeritus professor at the University of Oregon, believes\nhe has found evidence for communities resembling biocrusts in fossilized soils\n(or “paleosols”) as far back as 3.7 billion years ago — challenging the common\nassumption that life originated in the sea. “The evidence from paleosols is\npretty clear that there were all sorts of things on land, even very early on,”\nhe said. “You can see these microbial crust fabrics just with the naked eye.”\n\nA team led by Christophe Thomazo\n[https://biogeosciences.u-bourgogne.fr/en/equipe/thomazo-christophe-en], a\ngeobiologist at the University of Burgundy, has found evidence that some modern\nbiocrusts could have survived in the atmosphere of the early Earth during the\nArchean: Their microbes could have efficiently fixed gaseous nitrogen into\nammonium and nitrate, delivering accessible nutrients to the emerging global\necosystem. The researchers also noticed that some of the isotopic carbon and\nnitrogen content of some desert biocrusts is like that of rocks from the\nArchean.\n\n“There are signatures [in these biocrusts] that are compatible with Archean\norganic matter,” Thomazo said. He is “quite confident” that the planet’s first\nterrestrial residents were something akin to modern biocrusts.\n\nResilient but Fragile\n\nDuring the drive out of the park, Gutiérrez Alvarado stops the car, gets out,\nand turns around. His car’s tire tracks have sliced sharply through the dense\ncoverage of grit crust, leaving an array of microbial corpses in their wake. The\ncrust is resilient, but it’s far from indestructible, and even human footprints\ncan wipe out small chunks of it. That’s why the National Park Service has posted\n“Don’t bust the crust” signs across the western United States, urging hikers to\nstay on the paths to protect the breathing soil.\n\nMale human figure walking away from the viewer and toward a car through thick\nfog. Footprints in the desert crust are visible behind him.\n[https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2023/07/CarinFog-byZachSavitsky-scaled.webp]\n\nGutiérrez Alvarado walks back to his car through the fog. The desert crust is\nhighly sensitive to trampling by cars and hikers.\n\nZack Savitsky for Quanta Magazine\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGutiérrez Alvarado treasures the expanse of grit crust. As a ranger, his mission\nis to keep the park’s landscape and all that inhabits it safe from negligent\nvisitors and invasive mining operations, he said. In a study published in April\n[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2023.03.015] that he co-authored with Jung and\nvan den Brink, he urged the Chilean national park management to consider\nbiocrusts in their nature conservation plans.\n\n“We need to justify why we close roads or close some trails so no one can go\nthere,” Gutiérrez Alvarado said. “We don’t have laws, so the research is our\nbackup.”\n\nBut biocrusts face an anthropogenic threat much worse than footprints: climate\nchange.\n\nIn 2018, Belnap, Büdel and their colleagues published a study estimating how\ndifferent biocrusts around the world would adapt to climate change and land-use\nintensification. Their models predicted that by the end of the century, the\nglobal coverage of biocrusts could diminish by 25% or more. Those reductions\ncould make for less healthy soils and cause loose dust to settle onto snowpacks,\ntrapping more heat and worsening the planet’s climate ills. “Then we will truly\nstart to see the analogues with Mars,” van den Brink said.\n\nHowever, the Atacama biocrusts stand out in this model. Under advanced climate\nscenarios, when most other crusts die off, the grit appears to flourish.\n\nAs the sun recedes, Gutiérrez Alvarado, van den Brink and I climb up a sandy\nmound for one last glimpse of the rolling hills being swallowed by fog. From the\ntop, I can also admire the true expanse of the grit empire and its legions\nquietly claiming territory out to the horizon. I can’t help but think how all\nalong, the rocks may have been keeping one more secret: that if microbes like\nthese were the first to arrive, perhaps they’ll also be the last to go.\n\n\nNEXT ARTICLE\n\nNew Proof Threads the Needle on a Sticky Geometry Problem"

The ongoing Square Kilometre Array project and the recent\ndiscovery of high-redshift radio-loud quasars have made this method viable. This\nnew approach could unlock insights into the universe’s thermal history and dark\nmatter properties.\n\nThe mystery of the first galaxies of the universe is an indomitable urge of\nhuman beings. The formation of them is mastered by the nature of dark matter\n[https://scitechdaily.com/astronomy-astrophysics-101-dark-matter/] which is also\none of the most important problems faced by fundamental physics. However,\nunderstanding the nature of dark matter—for example, whether it is cold or\nwarm—and its subsequent effect on the first galaxy formation is a huge\nchallenge.\n\nNow, a joint research team from Northeastern University (China) and the National\nAstronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) has\nproposed using a novel probe to try to shed light on the nature of dark matter\nand the early formation of galaxies simultaneously.\n\nThe team’s study was published in the journal Nature Astronomy on July 6.\n\nSimulated 1-D Power Spectra of the 21-cm Forest\n[https://scitechdaily.com/images/Simulated-1D-Power-Spectra-21cm-Forest-777x393.png]https://scitechdaily.com/images/Simulated-1D-Power-Spectra-21cm-Forest.png\n\nThe simulated 1-D power spectra of the 21-cm forest. Credit: Shao et al.\n\nOne way of understanding dark matter is to try to measure the mass of dark\nmatter particles through cosmological observations of small-scale structures.\nBut detecting small-scale structures in which no star formation has ever\noccurred is difficult, especially during the cosmic dawn. Fortunately, atomic\nhydrogen gas in and around these dark, small structures from cosmic dawn creates\n21-cm absorption lines along the lines of sight between Earth and high-redshift\nradio point sources. These absorption lines are known collectively as the 21-cm\nforest.\n\nThe 21-cm forest probe is a theoretical concept proposed more than 20 years to\nprobe for gas temperatures and potentially for dark matter properties during the\ncosmic dawn. So far, scientists have not attempted to actually use the probe due\nto numerous challenges, including extremely weak signals, the difficulty in\nidentifying high-redshift background sources, and the degeneracy between the\nmass of dark matter particles and the heating effect, which would prevent the\nprobe from constraining either the particle mass or the heating effect from the\nfirst galaxies.\n\nRecently, though, a number of high-redshift radio-loud quasars have been\ndiscovered. In addition, construction on the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)—an\ninternational initiative to build the world’s largest radio telescope—began last\nDecember. Both these developments suggest that using the 21-cm forest probe will\nsoon be feasible.\n\nInspired by power spectrum analyses widely used in cosmological probes, the NAOC\nresearchers realized that the distinctive scale-dependences of the signals\ncaused by the warm dark matter effect and the heating effect, respectively,\ncould be used to statistically extract key features to distinguish the two\neffects.\n\nIn this study, the researchers proposed a novel statistical solution to\nsimultaneously solve the weak signal problem and the degeneracy problem, by\nmeasuring the one-dimensional (1-D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest. The\nsignal scale-dependence revealed by the amplitude and shape of the 1-D power\nspectrum makes the 21-cm forest probe a viable and effective means of\nsimultaneously measuring dark matter properties and the thermal history of the\nUniverse.\n\n“By measuring the one-dimensional power spectrum of the 21-cm forest, we can not\nonly make the probe actually feasible by increasing the sensitivity, but also\nprovide a way to distinguish the effects of warm dark matter models and early\nheating process,” said XU Yidong, corresponding author of the study. “We will be\nable to kill two birds with one stone!”\n\nIn scenarios where cosmic heating is not too severe, SKA Phase 1’s low-frequency\narray will be capable of effectively constraining both dark matter particle mass\nand gas temperature. In cases where cosmic heating is more significant,\nutilizing multiple background radio sources during SKA Phase 2 will enable\nrobust detection capabilities.\n\nThe 21-cm forest offers a viable means for constraining dark matter at redshift\nranges beyond the reach of other observations. By measuring the heating level,\nthe 21-cm forest provides a way to constrain the spectral properties of the\nfirst galaxies and the first black holes, so as to shed light on the nature of\nthe first bright objects in the Universe. Using the 21-cm forest probe will\nserve as an indispensable avenue for advancing our understanding of the early\nUniverse and peering into the mysteries of both dark matter and the first\ngalaxies.\n\nSince application of the 21-cm forest probe is closely tied to observations of\nhigh-redshift background radio sources, the next step will also involve\nidentifying more radio-bright sources at the cosmic dawn (such as radio-loud\nquasars and gamma-ray burst afterglows) that can be followed up in the SKA era.\n\nReference: “The 21-cm forest as a simultaneous probe of dark matter and cosmic\nheating history” by Yue Shao, Yidong Xu, Yougang Wang, Wenxiu Yang, Ran Li, Xin\nZhang and Xuelei Chen, 6 July 2023, Nature Astronomy.\nDOI: 10.1038/s41550-023-02024-7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02024-7]"

The cloud-like structure is\nmainly composed of icy debris which replenishes the Solar System with its\nlong-period comets, but it could also host a yet unknown, giant-like planet.\n\nSpeculationn about a hypothetical ninth planet (sorry Pluto) in the Solar System\nhave long been focused on Planet X\n[https://www.techspot.com/news/63539-scientists-find-evidence-ninth-planet-exists-our-solar.html],\nbut a recently published study proposes that an unknown, large planet could be\nhiding far beyond standard planetary orbits. This Uranus or Jupiter-like planet\nwould orbit the Solar System – and not just the Sun – within the Oort cloud,\nmeaning that it would dwell in the outermost limit of the Sun's gravitational\npull.\n\nAccording to the study\n[https://www.independent.co.uk/space/alien-planet-uranus-solar-system-b2372232.html],\nthese theoretical Oort cloud (exo)planets [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11109]\ncould be a standard feature for one in every 200 - 3,000 stars, which is likely\nan overestimation as the researchers didn't account for instabilities taking\nplace during the formation of a star and its planetary disk.\n\nScientists from the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and\nother research institutions ran complex \"N-body simulations\" of dynamical\ninstabilities to assess how a large planet could be cast out of a solar system,\nor how an already established planetary system could capture a runaway planet\nstrolling through the galactic plane.\n\n[https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2023/07/2023-07-12-image-2.jpg]\n\nThe estimated fraction of ejected planets that are trapped in the Oort clouds\nranges from 1 to 10%, the study says, which is depending on the initial\nplanetary mass distribution during the system's creation. If the Solar System's\ndynamical instability \"happened after birth cluster dissolution,\" the study\ncontinues, there's a 7% chance that an ice giant could be captured in the Sun's\nOort cloud.\n\nTherefore, the unknown giant planet at the edge of the Solar System could likely\nbe a wandering exo-planet that was captured by the Sun's gravitational influence\nafter the formation of the Solar System.\n\nThe Oort cloud surrounds the Sun at distances ranging from 2,000 to 200,000 AU,\nor 0.03 to 3.2 light-years, which means that the aforementioned gravitational\npull is pretty weak compared to what keeps the eight (confirmed) planets in the\nSolar System in place."

        "content": "Twenty-five years ago, two academics made a bet about consciousness. Christof\nKoch, a neuroscientist, wagered David Chalmers, a philosopher, that the brain\nmechanisms underlying consciousness\n[https://bigthink.com/the-well/human-consciousness-womb-after-birth/] would be\nknown by 2023. Chalmers thought otherwise.\n\nWhen they made the bet, many scientists were busy using newly developed\nneuroimaging technology to search for what they called the neural correlates of\nconsciousness [https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.22], defined by Koch, in\na recent interview [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plJXi54lp8c] with the\nSwedish science magazine Forskning & Framsteg, as “the footprints of\nconsciousness in the organ of consciousness, which is the brain.”  \n\nKoch and Chalmers agreed to set up a series of studies by rival consciousness\nresearchers, who would collaborate on experiments designed to test each others’\nideas about how the brain generates consciousness. The preliminary results of\nsome of these experiments were presented at the 26th annual meeting\n[https://theassc.org/assc-26/] of the Association for the Scientific Study of\nConsciousness (ASSC [https://theassc.org/]), held recently at New York\nUniversity, where Chalmers now directs the Center for Mind, Brain, and\nConsciousness.    \n\n\nTWO THEORIES OF CONSCIOUSNESS\n\nThe experiments were carried out in six independent laboratories and were\nspecifically designed to test the global workspace theory (GWT) and information\nintegration theory (IIT), the two leading theories of consciousness.\nFundamentally, the two theories differ in how they explain the neural basis of\nconsciousness: GWT explains it in terms of a set of brain structures, whereas\nIIT regards it as a computational function. \n\nAccording to GWT, which was proposed by Bernard Baars in the 1980s,\nconsciousness is generated by core neural architecture that processes largely\nunconscious information, and then the prefrontal cortex broadcasts that\ninformation to a wider network\n[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.749868/full], so that\nit enters conscious awareness. IIT, proposed by Giulio Tononi, states that\nconsciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information\n[https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2202-5-42], and\nthat a system becomes conscious when the amount of information being integrated,\ndesignated as Ф (phi), passes a certain threshold.\n\nThe results presented at the ASSC meeting showed that both theories are still\nincomplete — in other words, neuroscientists do not understand consciousness.\nSo, during the main event, Koch appeared on stage to present Chalmers with a\ncase of fine wine. \n\n\nTHE EASY PROBLEM ISN’T EASY\n\nChalmers is perhaps best known for making the distinction between the “easy” and\n“hard” problems of consciousness. The easy problem, which the wager focused on,\nis identifying the neural correlates of consciousness. It turns out the easy\nproblem isn’t all that easy.\n\nNeuroimaging experiments designed to investigate the neural correlates of\nconsciousness  typically involve scanning peoples’ brains while they view visual\nstimuli that drift in and out of conscious awareness, and then identifying the\nbrain structures that are engaged during these processes. This approach did\nindeed identify brain structures and mechanisms underlying conscious perception\nof sensory stimuli, but it ignored other important aspects of consciousness. \n\nWe all know at a gut level what it means to be conscious, but it is still very\ndifficult to define. We can say, though, that being conscious involves not only\nhaving awareness of the outside world, but also having awareness of one’s self\nand one’s relationship with the environment. While the brain surely plays a\nmajor role in generating our conscious experiences, awareness of one’s self\ninvolves complex interactions between the brain and the body. In order to gain a\nbetter understanding of the full spectrum of consciousness, we will need to take\nthese interactions into account.\n\n\nTHE (REALLY) HARD PROBLEM\n\nGiven that the easy problem is actually hard, the (really) “hard” problem of how\nphysical processes in the brain give rise to subjective conscious experience\nprobably will remain unsolved for a very long time to come. Perhaps it never\nwill be solved."

NASA\n\nExoplanet LTT9779 b was first spotted in 2020\n[https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/602431], but it's only recently that\nESA discovered how shiny it truly is. \n\nThanks to the agency's CHEOPS satellite\n[https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cheopshttps://www.businessinsider.com/space-telescope-cheops-launch-watch-live-2019-12],\nwhich studies exoplanets, scientists found the planet reflects about 80% of the\nlight it receives.\n\nBy comparison, Earth, which is fairly reflective, only bounces back 30% of its\nsunlight. Venus, the solar system's shiniest planet, reflects 75% of the\nsunlight.\n\nScientists believe the planet's mirror-like quality is due to the composition of\nits atmosphere. The metallic clouds that surround the planet are mostly made of\nsilicate – the stuff that makes up sand and glass — and metals like titanium,\nper ESA. \n\n\"Imagine a burning world, close to its star, with heavy clouds of metals\nfloating aloft, raining down titanium droplets,\" said study co-author James\nJenkins, an astronomer of Diego Portales University and CATA.\n\nAnd it's precisely this bizarre atmosphere that's fascinating scientists.\n\n\nA NEPTUNE-LIKE PLANET WITH AN ATMOSPHERE THAT SHOULDN'T EXIST\n\nAn artist's illustration shows how close the planet is to its sun. Ricardo\nRamírez Reyes (Universidad de Chile)\n\nExoplanet LTT9779 b is really close to its star. It is so close it orbits it in\njust under a day. It's also very big and very hot, about 3,6oo degrees\nFahrenheit, which means it's similar to Neptune\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/james-webb-space-telescope-captures-clearest-image-of-neptunes-rings-2022-9]. \n\nAnd therein lies the conundrum. Neptune is very far away from the sun. Every\ntime a planet has been found orbiting its star that closely before, it has\neither been a huge gas giant, similar to Jupiter, or a barren tiny rock planet\nsmaller than Earth.\n\n\"We expect planets like this to have their atmosphere blown away by their star,\nleaving behind bare rock,\" Parmentier said.\n\nThe secret may lie in the composition of the clouds themselves. \n\n\"We believe these metal clouds help the planet to survive\" in these conditions\nsaid study author Sergio Hoyer of the Marseille Astrophysics Laboratory.\n\n\"The clouds reflect light and stop the planet from getting too hot and\nevaporating. Meanwhile, being highly metallic makes the planet and its\natmosphere heavy and harder to blow away,\" he said. \n\nThe findings were published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics\n[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/07/aa46117-23/aa46117-23.html]\nMonday."

An inset to the\nimage shows a photo of a kagome weave basket\n[https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Low-Res_Topol_G.jpg]https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Low-Res_Topol_G.jpgThree\nperspectives of the surface on which the electrons move. (Courtesy: University\nof Bologna)\n\nAn international team of physicists has succeeded in measuring a property of the\nelectron known as topological spin winding for the first time. The team obtained\nthis result by studying the behaviour of electrons in so-called kagome metals,\nwhich are materials that have unique quantum properties related to their\nphysical shape, or topology. The work could advance our understanding of the\nphysics of superconductors and other systems that contain strongly correlated\nelectrons.\n\nKagome metals are named after a traditional Japanese basket-weaving technique\nthat produces a lattice of interlaced, symmetrical triangles with shared\ncorners. When the atoms of a metal or other conductor are arranged in this\nkagome pattern, their electrons behave in unusual ways. For example, the\nwavefunctions of the electrons can interfere destructively, resulting in highly\nlocalized electronic states in which the particles interact strongly with each\nother. These strong interactions lead to a range of quantum phenomena, including\nmagnetic ordering of unpaired electrons spins that can produce, for example,\nferro- or antiferromagnetic phases, superconducting structures, quantum spin\nliquids and abnormal topological phases. All these phases have applications in\nadvanced nanoelectronics and spintronics technologies.\n\nIn the new work, researchers led by Domenico Di Sante\n[https://www.domenicodisante.com/] of the University of Bologna in Italy\n[https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/domenico.disante/en] studied the spin and\nelectronic structure of XV6Sn6, where X is a rare-earth element. These\nrecently-discovered kagome metals contain a Dirac electronic band and a nearly\nflat electronic band. At the point at which these bands meet, an effect called\nspin-orbit coupling creates a narrow gap between the bands. This spin-orbit\ncoupling also creates special type of electronic ground state at the material’s\nsurface.\n\n To investigate the nature of this ground state, Di Sante and colleagues used a\ntechnique known as spin angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (spin ARPES).\nIn this technique, high-energy photons generated by a particle accelerator, or\nsynchrotron, strike the material from different directions, causing it to absorb\nlight and emit electrons. The energy, momenta and spin of these emitted\nelectrons can be measured, and the data used to map the material’s electronic\nband structure.\n\n\n\n\nPOLARIZED SURFACE ELECTRONIC STATES\n\n\n\nBy combining these measurements with advanced density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations, the researchers confirmed that the kagome geometry in TbV6Sn6 does\nindeed give rise to a gap between the Dirac band and the nearly flat band. Such\na gap is common to all kagome lattices that show spin-orbit coupling, but while\nphysicists had known about the gap’s existence for years, no one had previously\nmeasured a property called topological quantum spin curvature that results from\nthe gap and is related to the curved space in which electrons reside.\n\n“In the same way that the space-time of our universe is curved by matter, stars,\ngalaxies and black holes, the space in which the electrons move can also be\ncurved,” Di Sante explains. “We have detected this curvature in kagome metals.”\n\nRead more\n\nArtist's impression of a kagome lattice\n[https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Low-Res_Kagome-Lattice-F_web-128x90.jpg]\n\nLOOPY CURRENTS APPEAR IN A KAGOME SUPERLATTICE\n\n[https://physicsworld.com/a/loopy-currents-appear-in-a-kagome-superlattice/]\n\nThe new work represents a first step towards a thorough characterization of this\ncurved space – a key goal in the field of quantum geometry, Di Sante adds. “This\nis a property of quantum materials that we’ve started exploring only recently\nand we already know that quantum geometry is also intimately linked to\nsuperconductivity and other fascinating phenomena,” he says. “We hope that the\nprotocol we have introduced here will help to shed light on the physics of\nquantum materials.”"

Today, that number is over\n6,000, with SpaceX controlling over 4,000. As space around Earth becomes ever\nmore crowded, the chance of a collision increases. New data released by the FCC\nshows how serious that problem might become. In the past six months, SpaceX has\nbeen forced to reroute its satellites to avoid collisions more than 25,000\ntimes.\n\nOn the one hand, it's good to know that SpaceX is working to limit close\ninteractions between orbiting objects. However, 25,000 avoidance maneuvers in\njust six months is a lot. That works out to 137 maneuvers every single day. The\nFCC report (PDF [https://t.co/aTzV2gTS7H]) also includes the total number of\nrecorded avoidance maneuvers from all four years of Starlink's existence:\n50,000.\n\nThe total number of avoidance maneuvers might have been startling and\nconcerning, but the rapid increase in close calls is the most troubling part.\nSpaceX launched its megaconstellation so quickly that it became the single\nlargest satellite operator in the world almost overnight. SpaceX conducted a\nrelatively small number of maneuvers early on, but the rate has shot up, with\n50% of the total in 2023.\n\nA series of near misses in the early years of Starlink led the European Space\nAgency to call for better oversight\n[https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/297925-esa-calls-for-space-traffic-rules-after-near-miss-with-spacex-satellite]\nof space traffic. NASA and SpaceX agreed to something like that in 2021\n[https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/321037-nasa-and-spacex-sign-agreement-to-avoid-space-collisions],\nbut that agreement was made when Starlink consisted of just 1,000 nodes. We are\nin uncharted territory with so many satellites in orbit, and this is just the\nstart. Space.com [http://space.com/] reports that the rate of maneuvers is\nincreasing geometrically, doubling every six months.\n\nStarlink V2 Starship\n[https://i.extremetech.com/imagery/content-types/05tONPrP4ULCJSgKIIrr4fE/images-1.fill.size_670x377.v1689106913.jpg]\n\nSpaceX will use the upcoming Starship rocket to deploy most of the 7,500 new\nsatellites approved by the FCC> Credit: SpaceX\n\nSpaceX has approval from the FCC to launch 7,500 more satellites\n[https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/341286-fcc-spacex-can-only-launch-7500-second-gen-starlink-satellites],\nand the company has talked about eventually having as many as 42,000 in its\nswarm. Meanwhile, Amazon plans to deploy its Kuiper internet satellite network,\nand smaller players will have cheaper, easier access to space as SpaceX and\nother aerospace firms perfect reusable vehicles.\n\nSpaceX has explained that it will reroute satellites if there's even a slight\nchance of collision, so we're not talking about 25,000 avoided collisions.\nHowever, the satellites are clearly passing SpaceX's red line with much greater\nfrequency as it expands the network. Even a single high-speed crash in space\nwould have disastrous consequences, spreading debris that could damage or\ndestroy other satellites. There's even a theoretical outcome called Kessler\nSyndrome, where a chain reaction of space junk collisions makes low-Earth orbit\n[https://www.extremetech.com/science/what-is-low-earth-orbit-leo] inaccessible.\nAvoidance maneuver protocols will be essential as the population of satellites\ngrows by thousands or even tens of thousands in the coming years.

        "content": "Scientists have known about the existence of a 'gravity hole' in Indian Ocean\nfor decades but have long been left puzzled as to why it exists. \n\nKnown officially as the 'Indian Ocean Geoid Low', it isn't a conventional\nphysical hole, but rather a region of the ocean where gravity is lower than\naverage.\n\nThis dip in gravity means the water level is around 340 feet lower than the\nsurrounding area – like a groove in a 'bumpy potato'. \n\nNow, a team of researchers in India\n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/india/index.html] claim the gravity hole was\nformed by plumes of low-density magma that rose up from Earth's mantle. \n\nThese plumes were generated by the remains of a sunken tectonic plate\ncalled Tethys, lost when India became part of Asia 50 million years ago\n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3311026/The-biggest-continental-collision-Earth-s-history-Scientists-pinpoint-crashing-continents-created-Himalayas-50-million-years-ago.html]. \n\nAlso known as a geoid, the gravity hole isn't a physical hole, but a region of\nthe ocean where gravity is lower than average. The Indian Ocean geoid low (IOGL)\nis the deepest geoid on Earth\n\nEarth's mantle is a layer of silicate rock between the crust and the outer core.\nPictured are the layers of our planet\n\nMantle plumes – upwellings of abnormally hot rock within the Earth's mantle –\nare generally thought to caused by gravitational anomalies around the Earth. \n\nThe new study was conducted using computer simulations by two geophysicists at\nthe Indian Institute of Science in the city of Bengaluru. \n\n'Using these simulations we could see this geoid low being non-existent at some\npoint and then taking shape at about 20 million years ago,' study\nauthor Attreyee Ghosh told MailOnline. \n\n'Such kind of studies would help us address many of the Earth's still unresolved\nfeatures in the future.' \n\nEarth is often depicted as a perfectly round sphere in illustrations and\nphysical globes, but experts think it's more like a 'bumpy potato' in terms of\nits shape.\n\nOur planet's uneven surface is due to areas of non-uniform gravity resulting\nfrom the unequal distribution of matter in its interior. \n\nAdding to the surface deformations is the movement of tectonic plates that have\ncreated mountains and valleys on the Earth's surface. \n\nSince the oceans cover around 70 per cent of the planet's surface, these\ndeformities affect the shape of the oceans too. \n\n'Geoid anomalies' are generated by uneven mass distribution within the deep\nEarth. One such point of low gravity is found just south of the Indian\npeninsula, called the Indian Ocean Geoid Low (IOGL), spanning a vast extent\nsouth of the Indian subcontinent\n\nThe 'Indian Ocean Geoid Low' was discovered in 1948 by Dutch geophysicist Felix\nAndries Vening Meinesz (pictured)\n\nNo more is this illustrated than by the Indian Ocean Geoid Low, which can be\nfound around 700 miles south of the Indian peninsula. \n\nIt was discovered in 1948 by Dutch geophysicist Felix Andries Vening Meinesz\nduring a ship-based gravity survey, when he found the sea level in the region\nwas significantly lower than the global average, indicating a gravitational\nanomaly. \n\nWhile we have sent missions to probe the outer reaches of our solar system, the\ndeepest boreholes on Earth go down to only a few miles, so looking for answers\nwithin our planet is somewhat of a challenge. \n\nTo address this, the experts used computer software to track how Earth's\ntectonic plates may have moved around the hole in the past 140 million years. \n\nViolent interactions between the tectonic plates may hold clues about why this\ngravitational anomaly exists today, they figured. \n\nIt's well known that Earth's lithosphere – its rocky, outermost shell – is\nformed of around 15 tectonic plates that are constantly moving and grinding past\neach other. \n\nAround 50 million years ago, the relatively small Indian plate began colliding\nwith the much bigger Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas\n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3311026/The-biggest-continental-collision-Earth-s-history-Scientists-pinpoint-crashing-continents-created-Himalayas-50-million-years-ago.html]. \n\nPrior to this, the Indian plate was part of an ancient southern 'supercontinent'\nreferred to today as Gondwana, but it had started to drift northwards. \n\nWhen the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate, another plate between\nthe two – Tethys – was subducted and engulfed into the mantle. \n\nMap shows the arrangement of the Earth's tectonic plates today. Note the\nrelatively small Indian plate, marked in red  \n\nThe Indian plate used to be part of an ancient southern 'supercontinent'\nreferred to today as Gondwana. Pictured are the historic plates and their\nmovement as Gondwana broke apart (a process thought to have started around 120\nmillion years ago)\n\nTethys was the location of a vast ocean, home to a diverse ecosystem of marine\nlife, including fish, sharks, whales and dolphins. \n\nAccording to the researchers, slabs of the Tethys plate sank into Earth's lower\nmantle and churned up magma, generating the plumes. \n\n'These plumes, along with the mantle structure in the vicinity of the geoid low,\nare responsible for the formation of this negative geoid anomaly,' they say in\ntheir paper. \n\nThe team say the question of how the Indian Ocean Geoid Low came to be has been\n'controversial', but they show that the plumes were 'integral' in its creation.\n\nThey study has been published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters\n[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL102694].\n\n\nTHE EARTH IS MOVING UNDER OUR FEET: TECTONIC PLATES MOVE THROUGH THE MANTLE AND\nPRODUCE EARTHQUAKES AS THEY SCRAPE AGAINST EACH OTHER\n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/fb-5523461/WHAT-TECTONIC-PLATES.html]\n\nTectonic plates are composed of Earth's crust and the uppermost portion of the\nmantle. \n\nBelow is the asthenosphere: the warm, viscous conveyor belt of rock on which\ntectonic plates ride.\n\nThe Earth has fifteen tectonic plates (pictured) that together have moulded the\nshape of the landscape we see around us today \n\nEarthquakes typically occur at the boundaries of tectonic plates, where one\nplate dips below another, thrusts another upward, or where plate edges scrape\nalongside each other. \n\nEarthquakes rarely occur in the middle of plates, but they can happen when\nancient faults or rifts far below the surface reactivate. \n\nThese areas are relatively weak compared to the surrounding plate, and can\neasily slip and cause an earthquake."

Credit: NASA/ ARC/ MIT\n\nA group of scientists has made a fascinating discovery regarding an unusually\nhuge heat-emitting blob located on the far side of the moon. This enigmatic\nhotspot appears to have originated from a massive hidden deposit of granite, a\ntype of rock that is rarely found in such large amounts beyond our planet.\n\nRecent research suggests that this extraordinary chunk of granite can be traced\nback to a dormant volcano on the moon, which has remained inactive for an\nastonishing 3.5 billion years.\n\nAccording to Matt Siegler, the main researcher from the Planetary Science\nInstitute in Tucson, Arizona, “This is more Earth-like than we had imagined can\nbe produced on the Moon, which lacks the water and plate tectonics that help\ngranites form on Earth.”\n\n\nDETECTION OF SUBSURFACE TEMPERATURES ON THE MOON\n\nBy employing a novel technique utilizing microwaves, scientists Matt Siegler and\nRita Economos, in collaboration with Chinese lunar orbiters Chang’E 1 and 2, as\nwell as NASA’s\n[https://greekreporter.com/2023/06/29/nasa-rover-donut-shaped-rock-mars/] Lunar\nProspector and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiters, have successfully detected and\nmeasured subsurface temperatures on the moon\n[https://greekreporter.com/2023/07/10/earth-new-moon/].\n\nTheir investigation led them to a specific region spanning approximately 31\nmiles (50 kilometers) in diameter, exhibiting a temperature roughly 18 degrees\nFahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) higher than the surrounding areas.\n\nThis anomalous zone is situated beneath a surface feature measuring about 12.4\nmiles (20 kilometers) in diameter, known for its high silicon content and\nsuspected to be a collapsed volcanic crater.\n\nAlthough the dormant volcano\n[https://greekreporter.com/2023/04/29/undersea-volcanoes-discovered-satellites/]\nceased erupting an astounding 3.5 billion years ago, residual magma from its\ninternal plumbing system is presumed to persist beneath the moon’s surface,\nemitting radiation and contributing to the observed elevated temperatures.\n\nIn a statement, Rita Economos explained, “This find is a 50 km-wide batholith; a\nbatholith is a type of volcanic rock that forms when lava rises into the Earth’s\ncrust but does not erupt onto the surface.”\n\nOn July 5, the scientists shared their preliminary discoveries in the esteemed\nscientific journal Nature\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06183-5?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=commission_junction&utm_campaign=CONR_PF018_ECOM_GL_PHSS_ALWYS_DEEPLINK&utm_content=textlink&utm_term=PID100052171&CJEVENT=dfdce93d201911ee81c703730a18b8f7].\n\n\nGOLDSCHMIDT CONFERENCE ON GEOCHEMISTRY\n\nFurther elaboration was provided on the findings during a presentation at the\nGoldschmidt Conference on Geochemistry in Lyon, France.\n\n> Three days into #Goldschmidt2023\n> [https://twitter.com/hashtag/Goldschmidt2023?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]!\n> Heard some great talks, saw old friends and met very cool people!

Elardo, a geochemist from the University of\nFlorida who was not directly involved in the study, expressed his utmost\nfascination, stating the findings as “incredibly interesting.”\n\nElardo emphasized that while granite is abundantly found on Earth, it remains\nconspicuously absent elsewhere within our solar system. “People don’t think\ntwice about having a granite countertop in their kitchen.”\n\nHe further said, “But geologically-speaking, it’s quite hard to make granite\nwithout water and plate tectonics, which is why we really don’t see that type of\nrock on other planets. So if this finding by Siegler and colleagues holds up,\nit’s going to be massively important for how we think about the internal\nworkings of other rocky bodies in the Solar System.”"

Mars is the most similar planet to Earth in the Solar\nSystem. Understanding Martian climate processes promises to uncover details of\nthe evolution and history of Earth and other planets in our Solar System,\" said\nlead author Prof. Li Chunlai from the National Astronomical Observatories of the\nChinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC).\n\nFile photo taken on Mars approximately in September 1976 at Utopia Planitia by\nthe US Viking 2 unmanned spacecraft. (credit: REUTERS)\n\n\nCHANGES IN MARS' TILT COULD HAVE PUSHED CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nThe researchers estimated that a change in the angle of the rotational axis of\nMars caused the Red Planet to exit the ice age, leading to effects on the\nmorphology, orientation, physical properties and layering of dunes.\n\nOther past studies have estimated that changes in Mars' rotational axis could\ncause climate change on the Red Planet. Mars' rotational axis changes relatively\nfrequently, with substantial changes recorded on timescales of hundreds of\nthousands to millions of years. In 2007, researchers from the University of\nHawaii theorized that a wobble in Mars' axis led to vast amounts of ice shifting\nbetween the poles and the rest of the planet every 120,000 years, as the wobble\ncaused big changes in the amount of sunlight reaching different parts of Mars.\n\n\"Understanding the Amazonian climate is essential to explain the current Martian\nlandscape, volatile matter reservoirs, and atmospheric state, and to relate\nthese current observations and active processes to models of the ancient climate\nof Mars. Observations of the current climate of Mars can help refine physical\nmodels of Martian climate and landscape evolution, and even form new paradigms,\"\nsaid Chunlai. \"We will continue to study both Amazonian and present-day climate\nto promote the knowledge regarding the last two billion years of Martian climate\nhistory, including its environment and processes.\""

        "content": "It’s hard to believe, but it was only 100 years ago — back in 1923 — that\nhumanity first realized that the Milky Way galaxy didn’t encompass the entire\nUniverse. That key discovery was made by Edwin Hubble, who, while observing what\nwas then known as the Great Nebula in Andromeda, recognized that a periodic\nlight “flare” he was seeing wasn’t a nova as he originally thought, but was\nrather a variable star located much, much farther away than any of the Milky\nWay’s stars. It was the first slam-dunk evidence that these spiral (and\nelliptical) nebulae, observed for centuries, were actually galaxies all unto\nthemselves, or as they were called at the time, “island universes.”\n\nToday, we now know that the observable Universe contains several trillion\ngalaxies, with the earliest dating back to when the Universe was less than 3% of\nits present age. While we’ve only mapped out a tiny fraction of all the galaxies\nthat exist, we’ve seen enough that we can not only describe what the Universe is\nlike at each moment in cosmic history, but we can compose 3D visual\nreconstructions that show how the Universe’s galaxies appear and grew up over\ntime. With a new, spectacular fly-through video\n[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/new-3d-visualization-highlights-5000-galaxies-revealed-by-webb]\nreleased by NASA and the JWST CEERS (Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science)\nteam, we can all now see what the Universe looks like for ourselves: from the\nMilky Way to farther back than ever before.\n\n\n\nStart: the Milky Way\n\nOur journey through the Universe begins right here at home, within our own Milky\nWay. One of the best-studied parts of the Universe is the closest region around\nour own Sun: including the stars, nebulae, and other objects located within only\na few thousand light-years of ourselves. While the individual stars themselves\nmight be the points of light we think of most frequently whenever we look up at\nnight, as they are the easiest things to observe, our galaxy consists of so much\nmore. This includes:\n\n * gas,\n * dust,\n * stellar remnants,\n * star-forming regions,\n * and even hot, ionized plasma.\n\nThe new stars that form throughout the Milky Way are dominated by just a few\nlarge star-forming regions, with the closest one to us being located in the\nconstellation of Orion: the great Orion Nebula. Containing many thousands of\ntimes the mass of our Solar System and with over 1000 new, young stars inside,\nthis nebula is just a fairly typical example of one of the Milky Way’s\nstar-forming regions. It’s fairly similar to other dense collections of gas,\ndust, and new stars found in our Milky Way, including the Omega Nebula, the\nEagle Nebula, and the Carina Nebula, among others.\n\nmilky way Gaia\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gaia_the_Galactic_census_takes_shape_pillars.jpg?w=1920]\n\nGaia’s all-sky view of our Milky Way Galaxy and neighboring galaxies. The maps\nshow the total brightness and color of stars (top), the total density of stars\n(middle), and the interstellar dust that fills the Galaxy (bottom). Note how, on\naverage, there are approximately ~10 million stars in each square degree, but\nthat some regions, like the galactic plane or the galactic center, have stellar\ndensities well above the overall average.\n\nCredit\n[https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia/Gaia_creates_richest_star_map_of_our_Galaxy_and_beyond]:\nESA/Gaia/DPAC\n\nBut perhaps the most spectacular part of our galaxy is the galactic center,\nextremely rich in stars and in possession of the Milky Way’s most massive black\nhole. Although the center of the galaxy is invisible to us in optical\nwavelengths of light, as the neutral matter within our galaxy’s disk blocks all\nthe sources of light from the Milky Way’s central region, we can see clear\nthrough in infrared and radio wavelengths of light.\n\nQuite spectacularly, the ESA’s Gaia mission has mapped more than a billion stars\nfrom within our Milky Way, and has shown us better than ever before what a\njourney to the center of our galaxy would look like. At the galactic core, our\nsupermassive black hole anchors a slew of fast-orbiting stars, many of which are\nat risk of being torn apart from the intense tidal gravitational forces there.\nOthers will be kicked to higher orbits or even swallowed entirely over time; our\ngalactic center is a dynamic, violent, and often devastating place.\n\nBy combining the data from a slew of telescopes across the world, we can even\nvisualize what a flight into the heart of the Milky Way\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVg3k0pEzzk] would look like, including the\norbits of the known stars closest to our supermassive black hole. It’s a\nspectacular view.\n\n\n\nNext: a leap to nearby galaxies\n\nHere in our Local Group, we’re seeing our Milky Way and our nearest neighboring\ngalaxies as they are at this moment in time: 13.8 billion years after the Big\nBang has taken place. As long as we restrict ourselves to the nearby Universe —\nto the galaxies whose light is arriving after a journey spanning a negligible\nduration of time relative to the age of the Universe — we’re seeing the Universe\neither as it is today or very nearly as it is today.\n\nAlthough we don’t presently have an all-sky view of the Universe within a few\nhundred million light-years, we’ve mapped out enormous regions of space that are\nvery close by, and have spent enough time with enough telescopes looking nearby\nthat we’ve identified all the major groups and clusters of galaxies in our local\nvicinity.\n\nRemarkably, we find that our Universe isn’t just a collection of individual\ngalaxies as well as groups and clusters of galaxies, but rather that there’s a\ncomplex, web-like structure to things. The matter in our late-time Universe is\npreferentially distributed along cosmic filaments, with groups and clusters of\ngalaxies forming at the nexuses and intersections of those filaments. In between\nthem, meanwhile, are vast cosmic voids, some of which span more than 100 million\nlight-years across.\n\nvoid cluster structure universe\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2019_05_Galaxy_superclusters_and_galaxy_voids-1200x675-1.png?w=960]\n\nIn between the great clusters and filaments of the Universe are great cosmic\nvoids, some of which can span hundreds of millions of light-years in diameter.\nWhile some voids are larger in extent than others, spanning a billion\nlight-years or more, they all contain matter at some level. Even the void that\nhouses MCG+01–02–015, the loneliest galaxy in the Universe, likely contains\nsmall, low surface brightness galaxies that are below the present detection\nlimit of telescopes like Hubble.\n\nCredit\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Galaxy_superclusters_and_galaxy_voids.png]:\nAndrew Z. Colvin and Zeryphex/Astronom5109; Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe first survey to map out more than 1 billion galaxies in the nearby Universe\n— that is, the Universe where it’s at least 90% of its present age — was the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey, which is still mapping our Universe in an ongoing\nfashion. If we wanted to know what the Universe looks like today, we can map out\nthese galaxies in three-dimensional space and visualize what it would be like to\nfly through the space between those galaxies at any speed we wanted: even faster\nthan the speed of light.\n\nThis was precisely what Miguel Aragon, Mark Subbarao and Alex Szalay did back in\n2012 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08LBltePDZw] with SDSS data: creating a\nvideo that showcases what a flight through the local Universe might look like.\n\nAs you can clearly see from the video below, galaxies come in a great variety of\nshapes, sizes, and groupings, with large numbers of giant elliptical galaxies\nfound within rich galaxy clusters and the more familiar spiral shapes found more\ncommonly on the outskirts of galaxy clusters and in what astronomers call “the\nfield,” or the regions of space that aren’t associated with any rich clusters.\nThis shows off what the Universe looks like today, but if we want to know what\nthe Universe looked like in the past, and describe how it grew up, we need to\nlook even deeper.\n\n\n\nAfter: going back in time and space\n\nOne of the most remarkable parts of the cosmic story is that the Universe, as it\nis today, is not the way it’s always been. Our Universe started out in a very\ndifferent state than what we experience today. Instead of being:\n\n * sparse,\n * filamentary,\n * cold,\n * and with rich, evolved galaxies that are grouped and clustered together,\n\nthe early Universe was different in every way. Today, we observe that the\nUniverse is expanding, and we know that the rate of cosmic expansion is directly\nrelated to the overall energy density of space itself.\n\nWell, back at earlier times, the Universe was denser, expanding faster, less\nclumpy and clustered (i.e., more uniform), and also hotter, as the photons\nwithin it hadn’t been stretched to the long wavelengths they now possess at\npresent. One of the most remarkable types of studies we’ve been able to perform\nare comparative galaxy studies: looking at the galaxies found within the\nUniverse today and comparing them to galaxies found farther away and whose light\nwas emitted at significantly earlier epochs in the Universe. Unsurprisingly, we\nfind that galaxies have evolved, from a population-wide perspective,\nsignificantly over the billions of years that have passed.\n\nmilky way galaxies cosmic time\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2017_07_p1345aw_0.jpg?w=960]\n\nGalaxies comparable to the present-day Milky Way are numerous throughout cosmic\ntime, having grown in mass and with more evolved structure at present. Younger\ngalaxies are inherently smaller, bluer, more chaotic, richer in gas, and have\nlower densities of heavy elements than their modern-day counterparts, and their\nstar-formation histories evolve over time. This was not discovered or well-known\nuntil only a few decades ago, when we began to see large numbers of galaxies\nfrom much earlier in our cosmic history.\n\nCredit\n[https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/tracing-the-growth-of-milky-way-like-galaxies/]:\nNASA, ESA, P. van Dokkum (Yale U.), S. Patel (Leiden U.), and the 3-D-HST Team\n\nOne of the best ways to see this for ourselves is to perform what’s known as a\n“pencil-beam” study of the distant Universe. In this technique, we observe one\nsingle, tiny region of sky that happens to be devoid of any relatively nearby\nstars or galaxies. We observe it for long durations of times in a variety of\nwavelengths, including (and, perhaps, especially) in long, infrared wavelengths\nof light: wavelengths that are excellent for discovering and imaging galaxies\nwhose starlight has been stretched to longer wavelengths by the cumulative\nexpansion of the Universe that occurred since their light was first emitted.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, the best views of the distant Universe\nin this fashion came courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope. The deepest view\never taken, prior to the launch of JWST, was of the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field\n[https://esahubble.org/videos/heic1214a/], which observed a region of space so\ntiny that it would take 32 million comparably-sized regions to cover the entire\nsky. In that little narrow “pencil beam” of space, more than five thousand\ngalaxies were revealed. They span all of cosmic history, from the relatively\nnearby Universe to more than 13 billion years ago: much closer to the Big Bang\nitself than to the present day.\n\nBy measuring the distances to these galaxies, we’ve been able to re-create what\na 3D flythrough of those galaxies, near and far alike, would look like.\n\n\n\nAt last: the deepest ever views\n\nBut there are several limitations from taking this approach.\n\n * First off, we aren’t seeing all of the galaxies out there; even in this deep\n   view (above), we’re probably only seeing somewhere around ~1% of all of the\n   galaxies that are out there. Most of them are small and faint, whereas the\n   easiest ones to see are big and bright. We know we are significantly biased\n   in what we’re able to detect.\n * Second off, most of the galaxies that exist are probably satellite galaxies\n   that orbit around the large, bright ones, and we don’t have the sensitivity\n   to observe them; we struggle to even count the number of galaxies in our own\n   Local Group, so the small, low-brightness galaxies that represent the most\n   common type of galaxy are largely invisible.\n * Third, for the first ~550 million years after the Big Bang (less in some\n   places, more in others), the Universe was filled with light-blocking neutral\n   matter, similar to what’s found in the disk of the Milky Way. We can only see\n   the light from these early epochs that’s bright enough to pierce through that\n   light-blocking veil.\n * And fourth, the brightest galaxies of all are the ones that are actively\n   forming stars over the entirety of the galaxy itself: a starburst galaxy. The\n   earlier we look, the more likely we are to be seeing a starburst galaxy, and\n   the more likely it is that the starbursting has been triggered by a major\n   merger of two comparably-sized galaxies.\n\nJWST reionization infographic\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/0_wTFmP51EB9Nrl_7L.png?w=960]\n\nMore than 13 billion years ago, during the Era of Reionization, the Universe was\na very different place. The gas between galaxies was largely opaque to energetic\nlight, making it difficult to observe young galaxies. The James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST) is peering deep into space to gather more information about\nobjects that existed during the Era of Reionization to help us understand this\nmajor transition in the history of the Universe.\n\nCredit\n[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/mapping-the-universes-earliest-structures-with-cosmos-webb]:\nNASA, ESA, J. Kang (STScI)\n\nAlthough all prior observatories have succumbed to these limitations, including\neven Hubble, this is precisely the class of observations that NASA’s James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST) has been designed to overcome. Looking at the Universe\nwith larger eyes optimized for infrared wavelengths and for penetrating this\nlight-blocking neutral matter, JWST has discovered many galaxies that have\nsurpassed even the limits of Hubble. Observing programs like JADES, CEERS,\nGLASS, Panoramic, Cosmos-Web, and more are showing us how the Universe grew up\nlike never before.\n\n[https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/horizontal_black.svg?w=128&h=96&crop=1]\n\nTravel the Universe with astrophysicist Ethan Siegel.

As Steve Finkelstein, principal investigator of the CEERS\ncollaboration, has put it:\n\n“The sheer number of galaxies that we’re finding in the early universe is at the\nupper end of all predictions. We’re used to thinking of galaxies as smoothly\ngrowing, but maybe these stars are forming like firecrackers. Are these galaxies\nforming more stars than expected? Are the stars they’re making more massive than\nwe expect? These data have given us the information to ask these questions. Now,\nwe need more data to get those answers.”\n\n\n\nWith each second that elapses in the above video, it’s as though we’re traveling\n200 million light-years farther into the data set, and looking farther and\nfarther back toward the moment of the Big Bang. The last galaxy shown here is\nknown as Maisie’s Galaxy: presently the fourth-most-distant spectroscopically\nconfirmed galaxy of all, behind two galaxies from the JADES collaboration\n(JADES-GS-z13-0 and JADES-GS-z12-0) and one from the GLASS collaboration\n(GLASS-z12).\n\nThe most distant galaxies that we’ve ever discovered are just the tip of the\ncosmic iceberg: the brightest and most massive galaxies found at these extreme\nreaches of the Universe. As we continue to collect more and more data, the\ndistant Universe will continue to come into focus, answering some of our present\nquestions and opening up new avenues to investigate. A full understanding of our\nUniverse, from the earliest times imaginable all the way to the present day, is\nfinally closer than ever to being within reach."

        "content": "To have a discovery via a Machine Learning algorithm, we need to have a large\ndataset of training data. There was a problem in predicting the molecular\nproperties and generating new molecules. This can be solved via Machine Learning\nand Deep Learning approaches. But, to solve this through these approaches would\nrequire a large amount of training data.\n\nThe goal of the researchers is to speed up the discovery of new molecules of\ndrugs and material development. In order to tackle this problem, researchers\nfrom MIT have found a way to predict the molecular properties of a molecule\nusing a small dataset. The team of researchers created a Machine Learning model\nthat automatically learns the language of molecules. It is known as ‘Molecular\nGrammar’. This technique is applied to a small dataset, which is more\nconvenient. It uses every information or grammar of the small dataset. It takes\nthe molecules with similar structures and understands the similarities between\nthese molecules. The system understands the laws governing the similarity of\nmolecules via Reinforcement Learning. The accuracy and  f1 score of the model is\nsuch that it gets closer to achieving its goal. Molecular Grammar is broadly\nclassified into two parts. The first part is called metagrammar,  while the\nsecond part is called the hierarchical approach.\n\nThis new system of Molecular Grammar gave better results than several Machine\nLearning models. It gives better results with a very small dataset as compared\nto the dataset used to predict molecular properties via Machine Learning models.\nIt is a powerful technique and can also apply to graph-based datasets. It makes\nit feasible for both regressions as well as classification approaches. Thus, to\npush their research further, the research team cut the training dataset into\none-half of the portion and found that this gave more better results. This was\none of the remarkable achievements which they had.\n\nThis method finds its uses in various domains, like predicting the physical\nproperties of glass transition temperature. The research team would like to\napply their molecular grammar model to 3D molecules and polymers. The molecular\ngrammar-based model leads to the discovery of new molecules and also in\npredicting their properties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck out the Paper  [https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SGQi3LgFnqj]and MIT Article\n[https://news.mit.edu/2023/learning-language-molecules-predict-properties-0707]. Don’t\nforget to join our 26k+ ML SubReddit, Discord Channel,\n[https://pxl.to/8mbuwy] and Email Newsletter\n[https://marktechpost-newsletter.beehiiv.com/subscribe], where we share the\nlatest AI research news, cool AI projects, and more.

        "content": "A groundbreaking study has shed new light on the astonishing diversity of\nprotein structures and their folds in nature. Researchers set out to reveal the\nextent to which nature has explored the vast landscape of possible protein\ntopologies. The results have unveiled an astounding array of unexplored protein\nfolds, expanding our understanding and uncovering the depth of the protein\nuniverse.\n\nThis research has been published in the journal Nature Structural and Molecular\nBiology on July 3, 2023.\n\nProteins, the building blocks of life, fold into specific three-dimensional\nstructures, enabling them to carry out their biological functions. The\nthree-dimensional structures of proteins are dictated by their amino acid\nsequences. While experimental techniques have successfully unraveled the\nstructures of numerous proteins over the years, the discovery of new protein\nfolds, defined by the arrangement and connectivity of α-helices and β-strands,\nhas become increasingly infrequent. This raises the question: how extensive is\nthe protein fold space not explored by nature?. In attempts to address this\nlong-standing question, theoretical studies have been conducted; however,\nexperimental validation is lacking.\n\nTo address this question, the research team embarked on a study combining\ntheoretical prediction for novel protein folds with experimental validation of\ntheir de novo designs.\n\nThe research team devised rules based on physical chemistry and protein\nstructure data to theoretically predict possible protein folds. These rules were\nthen employed to predict novel αβ-folds, which consist of a four to eight\nstranded β-sheet, not yet observed in the current Protein Data Bank (PDB). This\nled to the identification of a total of 12,356 novel folds. The team then\nattempted to computationally design proteins for the predicted novel folds from\nscratch to assess the foldability and fidelity of the novel folds.\n\n> We attempted to computationally design proteins with all of the predicted\n> folds that have a four-stranded β-sheet, including one forming a knot-like\n> structure. When designing proteins, we did not expect all of them, especially\n> knot forming ones, to fold into the structures as anticipated.\"\n> \n> Shintaro Minami, Researcher, Exploratory Research Center on Life and Living\n> Systems (ExCELLS)\n\nThe results of experimental testing were surprising (See Figure). \"For all of\nthe folds, the computationally designed protein structures closely matched the\nexperimental structures,\" said Naohiro Kobayashi, a senior research fellow at\nRIKEN.\n\nThese findings suggest the existence of at least approximately 10,000 unexplored\nfoldable αβ-folds, a significant revelation considering only 400 αβ-folds have\nbeen observed in nature. This suggests that many potential folds remain\nuncharted in the protein folding space.\n\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n * Diets rich in fiber, plant protein, and unsaturated fat may beneficially\n   modulate the gut microbiota involved in weight loss\n   [https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230613/Diets-rich-in-fiber-plant-protein-and-unsaturated-fat-may-beneficially-modulate-the-gut-microbiota-involved-in-weight-loss.aspx]\n * Novel protein modifies the cellular machinery responsible for producing\n   cellulose in plant cells\n   [https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230711/Novel-protein-modifies-the-cellular-machinery-responsible-for-producing-cellulose-in-plant-cells.aspx]\n * Study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of Batten disease\n   [https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230706/Study-provides-insights-into-the-molecular-mechanism-of-Batten-disease.aspx]\n\nThese results have given rise to several hypotheses about the structure and\nevolution of proteins. One hypothesis is that proteins may have not been present\nin biology long enough for all possible folds to have been explored. Another\nhypothesis is that protein folds in nature are inherently biased due to all life\non Earth having descended from a common ancestor. \"Proteins may have evolved by\nrepeatedly re-using specific folds while expressing different functions. If\nextraterrestrial life does exist, it might be utilizing a different set of\nprotein folds,\" said George Chikenji, an assistant professor at the Nagoya\nUniversity.\n\nProteins are known for their diverse functions, which are generated from the\ndiversity of protein three-dimensional structures. This study has revealed the\nexistence of at least approximately 10,000 uncharted foldable αβ-folds in\nnature. \"The design of proteins with these novel folds will lead to an even\ngreater diversity of structures. This would pave the way for the de novo design\nof functional protein molecules, lead to breakthroughs in drug development,\nenzyme design, and other areas,\" said Nobuyasu Koga, a professor at the\nExploratory Research Center on Life and Living Systems (ExCELLS), National\nInstitutes of Natural Sciences (NINS).\n\nThe research team includes Shintaro Minami (formerly at ExCELLS NINS); Naohiro\nKobayashi from RIKEN, Toshihiko Sugiki from the Institute for Protein Research\n(IPR), Osaka University (currently Kitasato University), Toshio Nagashima from\nRIKEN, Toshimichi Fujiwara from IPR, Osaka University, Rie Tatsumi-Koga from\nExCELLS NINS (currently IPR, Osaka University), George Chikenji from the Nagoya\nUniversity, Nobuyasu Koga from ExCELLS NINS, Institute for Molecular Science\n(IMS) NINS, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies) (currently\nIPR, Osaka University).\n\nSource:\n\nJournal reference:\n\nMinami, S., et al.

The eyes\nbelonged to an extinct group of animals called trilobites\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilobite], and their eyes were made of hard\ncrystal, a mineral known as calcite – a strange little quirk that gives us a\nwindow into how these early animals sensed the world around them.\n\nTrilobites died out about 250 million years ago but were around for some 300\nmillion years before that. There are also plenty of trilobite body plans in the\nfossil record, which suggests that those 300 million years were very successful\nones. And because their strange eyes were made of stone, they were often\nbeautifully preserved in the many fossils they left behind\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/trilobites-formed-orderly-queues-on-purpose-half-a-billion-years-ago].\n\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/07/trilobite-fossil.jpg]A curled-up\ntrilobite fossil. (Bryan Jones/Flickr/CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/bwjones/12106626446/])\n\nThis is how we know that trilobites had compound eyes\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084952121002780] like\ninsects, consisting of clusters of photoreception units called ommatidia\n[https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/ommatidia/], each with its own\nphotoreceptors and lenses. Examinations of broken sections of the fossilized\nlenses reveal a crystalline material made of calcite.\n\nPure calcite is transparent, so, in theory, light could penetrate it and be\nfocused, where the photoreceptors might detect it. As with insect vision, there\nwas likely a trade-off [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3054003/]:\nTrilobites probably didn't see in high spatial resolution, but they were\nparticularly sensitive to motion.\n\nThere were three kinds of these trilobite eyes. The oldest and most common is a\ntype known as holochroal [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holochroal_eye], in\nwhich small ommatidia were covered by a single corneal membrane, with the\nadjacent lenses in direct contact with each other.\n\nThe abathochroal eye is only seen in the family Eodiscidae\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eodiscidae]; the small lenses are each covered by\na thin cornea.\n\nFinally, the schizochroal eye is only seen in the Phacopina\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacopina] suborder. The lenses are larger,\nwidely separated, and each has its own cornea. They were probably, scientists\nbelieve, highly specialized\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467803921000062].\n\nThe holochroal eye is the most similar to modern apposition eyes\n[https://academic.oup.com/book/10639/chapter-abstract/158650905?redirectedFrom=fulltext]\nseen in some insects and crustaceans, and scientists believe they worked in a\nsimilar way\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/oldest-eye-ever-evolution-fossil-evidence-530-million-years-trilobite].\nEach ommatidium operates individually, and the image the insect sees is a mosaic\nof all the images combined [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0MqmNUz6WI].\n\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/07/schizochroal-eyes.jpg]Schizochroal\ntrilobite eyes. (Clarkson et al., Arthropod Struct. Dev., 2006\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S146780390600048X])\n\nThings get a little tricky with calcite, though. Calcite has one of the\nstrongest birefringences in nature\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/did-the-vikings-use-crystal-sunstones-to-discover-america].\nThat means it has two refractive indices; light will be split twice\n[https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Birefringence] as it travels through\ncalcite, the two rays traveling at different speeds, producing a double image.\n\nFor small ommatidia, as seen in the holochroal eye, this is unlikely to be a\nproblem [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467803921000062];\nthe deviation in the rays is smaller than the light-sensing organ.\n\nFor the schizochroal eyes, birefringence represents more of a problem. Crystal\nis not flexible, so the larger ommatidia can't change its focus to reduce the\neffect. Instead, scientists have found that schizochroal eyes have what is known\nas a doublet lens structure [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublet_(lens)].\n\nThat means the lens has two layers, each with a different refractive index, that\ncould correct for birefringence, almost like the trilobites had built-in\nspectacles. Lenses of this type were invented, separately, by mathematicians\nRene Descartes and Christian Huygens in the 17th century\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1771088/], unaware that trilobites\nhad beaten them to the punch.\n\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/07/sun-shade-eye.jpg]The eye of\ntrilobite Erbenochile erbeni had a built-in sunshade. (Moussa Direct\nLtd./Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Erbenochile_eye.JPG])\n\nFor all our understanding of the various structures of the trilobite's eye,\nthough, we still don't quite understand how the schizochroal eye worked, whether\nit was similar to an apposition eye or did something differently, as the\ndifferent structure\n[https://beatymuseum.ubc.ca/2017/10/26/trilobite-eyes-are-hard/] would suggest.\n\nA recent study\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/this-390-million-year-old-trilobite-fossil-had-a-bunch-of-tiny-eyes-inside-its-eyes]\nshowed schizochroal eyes are far more complex than we thought, which brings us\ncloser. Each lens was found to cover a small compound eye of its own, forming a\nsort of \"hyper-eye\".\n\nIt could even be possible we've been entirely wrong about trilobite vision. A\n2019 study questions [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1473-z] whether\nthe calcitic corneas may have been artifacts of the preservation process,\nimplying their crystal eyes are far less unique than many speculate.\n\nWe still don't know why this type of eye emerged – if it did at all – or what\nbenefits it conferred, but now scientists studying trilobite vision have a new\nway to look at it [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8027602/]."

The European Space Agency\n(ESA) will attempt to guide the satellite on its way down to minimize risk of\ndamage as its pieces hit the ground.\n\nCoastal Animals Are Thriving on Plastic Pollution Out in the Pacific Ocean |\nExtreme Earth\n\n * Off\n * English\n\nESA’s Aeolus satellite\n[https://gizmodo.com/spacecrafts-to-unravel-earths-mysteries-or-destroy-it-5052140],\nnamed after the ruler of winds from Greek mythology, has been orbiting Earth for\nthe past five years, measuring the planet’s winds on a global scale.\nUnfortunately, the satellite is nearly out of fuel and is being dragged down\nfrom its orbital altitude of 198 miles (320 kilometers) by gravity and increased\natmospheric drag due to a recent surge in solar activity.\n\nAeolus was not designed for a controlled reentry through Earth’s atmosphere.\nInstead, left to its own devices, the satellite would keep losing altitude until\nfinally burning up through Earth’s atmosphere in a few months time, with chunks\nof Aeolus crashing down on undesignated locations.\n\nIn order to prevent pieces of debris from potentially falling on populated\nareas, which would pose risk to people and property below, a team at ESA will\nattempt a first-of-its-kind assisted reentry. “This assisted reentry attempt\ngoes above and beyond safety regulations for the mission, which was planned and\ndesigned in the late 1990s,” Tim Flohrer, head of ESA’s Space Debris Office,\nsaid in a statement\n[https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/FutureEO/Aeolus/Guiding_Aeolus_safe_reentry].\n“Once ESA and industrial partners found that it might be possible to further\nreduce the already minimal risk to life or infrastructure even further, the\nwheels were set in motion.”\n\nTo help minimize the growing issue of defunct satellites zipping through Earth’s\norbit, some satellites are equipped with controlled reentry technology that\ndeorbits them to low altitudes so that the impact site for possible debris is\nwithin a controlled area. Although Aeolus was not built with that type of\ntechnology, ESA’s team of engineers will still try to bring it down gently.\n\nThe satellite is currently losing altitude at a rate of 0.6 miles (1 kilometer)\na day. Once Aeolus reaches an altitude of 173 miles (280 kilometers), the team\nwill send a series of commands to the satellite over a six-day period, using its\nremaining fuel to guide it towards an optimal position for atmospheric reentry.\n\nThe final maneuver will be conducted when the satellite is at an altitude of 93\nmiles (150 kilometers), directing Aeolus towards its fiery reentry through\nEarth’s atmosphere. The majority of the satellite will burn up on reentry,\nbut some pieces of debris might reach Earth. The point of the assisted reentry\nis for those pieces to land in remote areas.\n\n“Should all go to plan, Aeolus would be in line with current safety regulations\nfor missions being designed today,” Flohrer said.\n\nIt’s difficult to predict exactly when Aeolus will make its way through Earth’s\natmosphere; it’s currently predicted to take place end of July to beginning of\nAugust.\n\nThe satellite’s descent will accelerate over time as it comes closer to Earth\nand its gravitational field, in addition to the Sun possibly speeding things up\neven more if it emits solar flares or coronal mass ejections. Charged particles\nfrom the Sun heat Earth’s atmosphere, which prompts denser air to rise and\nfurther increases atmospheric drag on Aeolus, according to ESA.\n\n“We are confident we can succeed with this pioneering effort that will set a new\nstandard for space safety and sustainability now and in the future,” Tommaso\nParrinello, ESA’s Aeolus mission manager, said in the statement.\n\nFor more spaceflight in your life, follow us on Twitter [http://gizspaceflight/]\nand bookmark Gizmodo’s dedicated Spaceflight page\n[https://gizmodo.com/science/spaceflight]."

The research establishes a novel method to study the\nperception of absence, broadening the scope for future exploration in the realm\nof sensory perception.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n 1. Using auditory illusions, the researchers demonstrated that moments of\n    silence can distort our perception of time, similar to sounds.\n 2. The study concluded that silence is ‘perceived’ in a similar way to sounds,\n    suggesting that we can ‘hear’ silence.\n 3. The researchers plan to extend their investigation into the perception of\n    absence, including visual disappearances and the possibility of hearing\n    silences not preceded by sound.\n\nSource: Johns Hopkins University\n\nSilence might not be deafening, but it’s something that literally can be heard,\nconcludes a team of philosophers and psychologists who used auditory illusions\nto reveal how moments of silence distort people’s perception of time.\n\nThe findings address the debate of whether people can hear more than sounds,\nwhich has puzzled philosophers for centuries.\n\n“We typically think of our sense of hearing as being concerned with sounds. But\nsilence, whatever it is, is not a sound—it’s the absence of sound,” said lead\nauthor Rui Zhe Goh, a Johns Hopkins University graduate student in philosophy\nand psychology.\n\n“Surprisingly, what our work suggests is that nothing is also something you can\nhear.”\n\nThe research is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe team adapted well-known auditory illusions\n[https://neurosciencenews.com/web-stories/silence-sound-perception-234/] to\ncreate versions in which the sounds of the original illusions were replaced by\nmoments of silence. For example, one illusion made a sound seem much longer than\nit really was.\n\nIn the team’s new silence-based illusion, an equivalent moment of silence also\nseemed longer than it really was.\n\n\n\nCredit: Johns Hopkins University\n\nThe fact that these silence-based illusions produced exactly the same results as\ntheir sound-based counterparts suggests that people hear silence just as they\nhear sounds, the researchers said.\n\n“Philosophers have long debated whether silence is something we can literally\nperceive, but there hasn’t been a scientific study aimed directly at this\nquestion,” said Chaz Firestone, an assistant professor of psychological and\nbrain sciences who directs the Johns Hopkins Perception & Mind Laboratory.\n\n“Our approach was to ask whether our brains treat silences the way they treat\nsounds. If you can get the same illusions with silences as you get with sounds,\nthen that may be evidence that we literally hear silence after all.”\n\nLike optical illusions that trick what people see, auditory illusions can make\npeople hear periods of time as being longer or shorter than they actually are.\n\nOne example is known as the one-is-more illusion, where one long beep seems\nlonger than two short consecutive beeps even when the two sequences are equally\nlong.\n\nIn tests involving 1,000 participants, the team swapped the sounds in the\none-is-more illusion with moments of silence, reworking the auditory illusion\ninto what they dubbed the one-silence-is-more illusion.\n\nThey found the same results: People thought one long moment of silence was\nlonger than two short moments of silence. Other silence illusions yielded the\nsame outcomes as sound illusions.\n\nParticipants were asked to listen to soundscapes that simulated the din of busy\nrestaurants, markets, and train stations. They then listened for periods within\nthose audio tracks when all sound stopped abruptly, creating brief silences.\n\nThe idea wasn’t simply that these silences made people experience illusions, the\nresearchers said. It was that the same illusions that scientists thought could\nonly be triggered with sounds worked just as well when the sounds were replaced\nby silences.\n\n“There’s at least one thing that we hear that isn’t a sound, and that’s the\nsilence that happens when sounds go away,” said co-author Ian Phillips, a\nBloomberg Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Psychological and Brain\nSciences.\n\n“The kinds of illusions and effects that look like they are unique to the\nauditory processing of a sound, we also get them with silences, suggesting we\nreally do hear absences of sound too.”\n\nThe findings establish a new way to study the perception of absence, the team\nsaid.\n\nThe researchers plan to keep exploring the extent to which people hear silence,\nincluding whether we hear silences that are not preceded by sound. They also\nplan to investigate visual disappearances and other examples of things people\ncan perceive as being absent.\n\n\nABOUT THIS AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH NEWS\n\nAuthor: Roberto Molar Candanosa [https://hub.jhu.edu/]\nSource: Johns Hopkins University [https://hub.jhu.edu/]\nContact: Roberto Molar Candanosa – Johns Hopkins University\nImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n“The perception of silence\n[https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2301463120]” by Chaz Firestone et al.\nPNAS\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbstract\n\nThe perception of silence\n\nDo we only hear sounds? Or can we also hear silence? These questions are the\nsubject of a centuries-old philosophical debate between two camps: the\nperceptual view (we literally hear silence), and the cognitive view (we only\njudge or infer silence).\n\nHere, we take an empirical approach to resolve this theoretical controversy.\n\nWe show that silences can “substitute” for sounds in event-based auditory\nillusions. Seven experiments introduce three “silence illusions,” adapted from\nperceptual illusions previously thought to arise only with sounds.\n\nIn all cases, silences elicited temporal distortions perfectly analogous to\ntheir sound-based counterparts, suggesting that auditory processing treats\nmoments of silence the way it treats sounds. Silence is truly perceived, not\nmerely inferred."

These\nstrange swirling patterns are known to indicate the presence of anomalous areas\non the Moon\n[https://thedebrief.org/buried-on-the-far-side-of-the-moon-the-detection-of-a-mysterious-heat-emitting-object-leads-to-an-unexpected-discovery/]\nwhere an abundance of magnetic rocks is located.\n\nAlthough Earth is encased within a magnetosphere that helps to shield it against\nsolar winds\n[https://thedebrief.org/fastest-spacecraft-in-existence-helps-to-unravel-the-mystery-of-fast-solar-winds/],\nthe Moon has no such protective magnetic field and is bombarded by highly\nenergized particles emanating from the Sun. However, there are regions where\nmagnetic fields do occur on the Moon, which offset them similar to how water is\ndeflected off the top of an umbrella during heavy rain.\n\nMAPS lead investigator Jörg-Micha Jahn, Ph.D., said the device will “investigate\nhow the influx of the solar wind interacts with the localized magnetic fields\nand how it could affect features on the lunar surface.” Jahn says that SwRI’s\nnovel spectrometer should be able to assist NASA in finding out whether the\nsolar wind is delivering charged particles all the way to the lunar surface that\ncould play some role in the unusual magnetic phenomenon.\n\nWhile traditional spectrometers split light into wavelengths, MAPS will perform\na similar function with particles, providing an image in three dimensions of\ntheir movement and energetic properties that will help NASA scientists\nunderstand the ways that the solar wind is influenced by the magnetic anomaly at\nReiner Gamma.\n\nJahn told The Debrief in an email that spectrometers like the one SwRI designed\nfor NASA possess two primary components: the sensor it uses to steer, select,\nand detect particles; and the support electronic components, which operate the\ninstrument, in addition to providing power and data processing.\n\nAlthough an earlier generation of the same technology had been employed\npreviously on the ESA’s Rosetta mission, which rendezvoused with comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the latest iteration that came to fruition with MAPS\nhas seen several improvements.\n\n“Historically, electronics become obsolete over time,” Jahn told The\nDebrief. “Hence all the electronics on MAPS are modern designs.”\n\n“Superficially viewed, the MAPS performance is similar in some areas to that of\n[the Rosetta Ion and Electron Sensor, or IES] because what we measure is very\nsimilar,” Jahn added. “But underneath MAPS is a modern instrument that has a lot\nmore operational flexibility, and crucially, it has twice (electrons) and four\ntimes (ions) the spatial resolution of IES.”\n\nmagnetic anomaly\n[https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Low-Res_D026025_0446-1.jpg]James\nNoll and Benjamin Rodriguez prepare the MAPS instrument for delivery and\nintegration into NASA’s Lunar Vertex lander at the Southwest Research Institute\n(Credit: Southwest Research Institute).\n\nJahn says the increased spatial resolution the new system provides will allow\nresearchers to know where charged particles originate from more accurately than\nin past missions.\n\n“This is crucial for understanding the effect of the Reiner Gamma magnetic\nfields on the plasma streaming from the Sun,” Jahn said. “Will the plasma be\ndeflected? How much plasma is hindered from reaching the surface?”\n\n“Because electrons are so light,” Jahn said, “we can use them to attempt to map\nthe magnetic field of Reiner Gamma. Similar to Computer Tomography, the Sun\nmoves across the sky of the Moon, exposing Reiner Gamma to its plasma streams\nfrom different directions. By measuring what reaches the ground, we hope to be\nable to extract information about the shape of the field from those\nobservations.”\n\nAdditionally, the MAPS instrument will collect data that even the best orbital\nspacecraft currently observing the Moon cannot obtain, providing data at\nresolutions greater than four times what they can currently provide, thanks in\nlarge part to the power digital power supply capabilities and other features\nMAPS is equipped with.\n\nSection 31\n[https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/united-states-92351_1280-120x120.jpg]\nhttps://thedebrief.org/section-31-the-military-coders-who-hacked-how-we-track-objects-in-space/\n\n“MAPS incorporates a state-of-the-art digitally controlled high voltage power\nsupply that enables a wider field of view for detection of particles and\nenhanced energy resolution,” said MAPS project manager Prachet Mokashi in an\nemail to The Debrief.\n\n“To complement these, MAPS features an updated data handling system that enables\nmuch higher data collection and transmission rates,” Mokashi added. “All these\ntechnology improvements will enable MAPS to measure the 3-D distribution of\nplasma more accurately and help answer questions about the lunar surface\nmagnetic anomalies and their interactions with the solar wind.”\n\nAlong with data that NASA hopes to use to understand the Reiner Gamma region’s\nmagnetic anomaly, additional data obtained by the spectrometer will help\nscientists understand a range of other phenomena, which include erosion that\noccurs on the surfaces of distant planets and their surrounding moons, as well\nas similar occurrences on the exterior of asteroids and comets.\n\nOverall, Jahn said that he is glad “to be able to point to something as familiar\nas the Moon and to know that an instrument [we] developed will be up there\nhelping us to understand Earth’s closest neighbor.”\n\n“We are looking for clues to unravel the magnetic mysteries of the Moon and what\nthey tell us about its formation and evolution,” Jahn said.\n\nMicah Hanks is the Editor-in-Chief and Co-Founder of The Debrief.

In turn, fluctuating sea levels\naround continents and shallow inland seas provide new habitats for ocean life to\nthrive, the researchers found. \n\n\"Warm, shallow water environments are the primary cradles of marine\nbiodiversity,\" study co-author Dietmar Müller\n[https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/dietmar-muller.html],\na geophysics professor at the University of Sydney, told Live Science.\n\nThis cyclical flooding and drying up of continents goes back at least 250\nmillion years, the researchers wrote in the study, published Monday (July 10) in\nthe journal PNAS [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2221149120].\n\nThe slow ballet of tectonic plates explains the creation of these prolific\nhabitats. In areas called mid-ocean ridges, where movement in the Earth's mantle\npushes plates away from each other, hot magma and water rises to form new\noceanic crust — a process known as seafloor spreading. In other areas, these\ntectonic plates collide, with one sliding beneath the other through a process\ncalled subduction, pulling ocean water into the Earth's mantle, a process that\nlowers sea levels. The pace of these events can change the elevations of the\nocean floor and, consequently, sea-level rise, according to Müller. \n\n\"When there's a lot of new seafloor created and destroyed, that's when you get\nsea-level highs,\" he said. \"And when the system slows down … you get sea-level\nlows.\" \n\nRelated: Hunks of oceanic crust are wedged inside Earth's mantle\n[https://www.livescience.com/earth-mantle-transition-zone-stuck-slab.html]\n\nWhen sea levels rise and coastlines are flooded, this can create pockets of\nshallow seas, which may eventually give rise to new species that are uniquely\nsuited to these newly formed habitats, the researchers found. During the study,\nthe researchers compared plate tectonic movements and sea-level changes with\nmarine fossil records dating back 250 million years ago, which they largely\npulled from the Paleobiology Database [https://paleobiodb.org/#/], a public\nresource that combines data for fossils collected across geological history. \n\nTheir analysis revealed that tectonic changes that drove shallower sea levels in\nand around continents every 36 million years correlated with highly biodiverse\nperiods in the fossil record roughly 6 million to 8 million years later.\nEssentially, when sea level rise\n[https://www.livescience.com/tag/rising-sea-levels] peaked, it led to a peak in\nmarine biodiversity.\n\n\"There's essentially periods where mid-ocean ridges go faster and subduction\ngoes faster, and they're followed by periods when the system slows down,\" Müller\nsaid. \"Why exactly this process is cyclic like that is actually a question that\nwe haven't fully answered yet.\"\n\nThe new research provides growing evidence that global sea level change fueled\nby Earth's geological processes have largely influenced the biodiversity of\nmarine life over history, the study's authors say. \n\nThe study highlights how tapping into massive amounts of data within the\nPaleontology Database can be a \"game changer in its own right,\" Gareth Roberts\n[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/gareth.roberts], a senior lecturer in Earth\nSciences at Imperial College London, told Live Science. He added that the study\nis \"another foundation stone to understanding how marine fossil diversities\nchanged through time.\"\n\nAccording to the cycle, the Earth is currently at a sea-level low and marine\nbiodiversity low, if we were factoring in only tectonic-driven changes, Müller\nsaid. However, shifting tectonic plates aren't the only thing that can change\nsea levels and, as a result, the ocean's biodiversity. Human-caused climate\nchange [https://www.livescience.com/climate-change.html] is heating up ocean\ntemperatures and melting ice sheets, contributing to a global rise in sea\nlevels, research shows\n[https://www.livescience.com/where-sea-levels-are-changing.html]. This means\nsea-level rise and coastal flooding could happen much faster than previously\nobserved in the 36 million-year cycle, according to Müller.\n\n\"What we're talking about is not an alternative mechanism to explain global\nwarming,\" he said, adding that the rate of sea-level rise documented in their\nstudy is relatively slow. \"[The rates] at which we are changing the climate and\nthe surface environments now are faster than ever in the geological record.\"\n\n\n\nStay up to date on the latest science news by signing up for our Essentials\nnewsletter.\n\nKiley Price is a Live Science staff writer based in New York City.

        "content": "Traditional symbols of strength and permanence, many large forest trees have\nbegun to look remarkably vulnerable to the stresses of sharing the planet with\nhumans—from climate change to invasive pests transported from one corner of the\nworld to another. As many as 100 U.S tree species could be wiped out in the\ncoming decades, scientists reported last year.\n\nThe latest threat has been marching across northeastern forests, killing one of\nthe most common and abundant types of trees in our region. Beech leaf disease\n(BLD) devastates all species of beech trees, from ornamentals used in\nlandscaping to those smooth-barked, 120-foot-tall behemoths that are a frequent\ncanvas for people carving their initials.\n\nUniversity of Maryland Extension Agent Associate John Hooven has firsthand\nexperience with BLD, surveying a forest that was hit with it in 2021 in Cortland\nCounty, New York. We recently sat down with him to get the facts about this new,\nstill-mysterious disease and what it could mean for the state and region.\n\nWhat is BLD?\nBeach leaf disease is a foliar disease, meaning it affects the leaves of the\ntree [https://extension.umd.edu/resource/beech-leaf-disease-0], and it’s caused\nby a non-native nematode, which is a microscopic type of worm-like organism. It\nwas first identified in Ohio in 2012, and has since spread across the Northeast.\nIt’s been identified in 11 states and Ontario, Canada, and the consensus is that\nit’s in Maryland, based on observations in both Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nMaryland Department of Agriculture has been actively looking for it but has yet\nto identify it here.\n\nHow bad is it? Could it wipe out beech trees like Dutch elm disease did?\nThat seems to be a possibility, but there are still a lot of unknowns. It seems\nto impact young beech trees more than older ones, but both are affected,\nincluding very large trees. Mortality occurs within two to seven years, and\nthere is no known remedy to date, no way to mitigate it. That’s concerning\nbecause it’s spreading rather fast for a tiny little nematode. There is the idea\nthat it could be treated with some sort of spray, but in a forest setting,\nthat’s not going to be practical.\n\nWhat tactics are forest managers using to prevent or slow its spread?\nAt this point in time, we're just in an observe-and-report mode. Wherever it’s\nfound, it’s good to get that information back to the researchers and the labs\nthat are working on the issue. There are some trials going on in Ohio to\ninvestigate different treatment options such as the use of one chemical that can\nstrengthen trees’ resistance to the disease or injecting insecticides directly\ninto tree stems to kill the nematodes without hurting other insects.\n\nHow important are beech trees to Maryland forests?\nBeech trees are very important to the whole region. They’re some of the most\ncommon trees in Maryland forests, and they can live for hundreds of years. They\nprovide important habitat for birds and small animals, and their nuts are\nedible, so they provide food for species such as bear and other animals. Beech\ntrees are also shade-tolerant, so most species will grow in established forests\nwhere other trees won't, which means they fill an important ecological role.\n\nWhat can I do to protect my beech trees?\nSince it’s still unknown how it’s being vectored, it’s very important not to\nmove materials from potentially infected areas to uninfected areas. That\nincludes any yard debris, firewood, leaves, soil, seedlings and things like\nthat. Landowners with beech trees on their property should monitor their trees\nfor the symptoms of the disease and avoid moving materials around their\nproperty.\n\nHow can I identify it?\nWhat’s most identifiable\n[https://extension.umd.edu/resource/maryland-beech-trees-under-attack-novel-microbe]\nabout BLD is the banding between the veins of the leaves, especially when you\nare looking up into the canopy from below. If you’re looking at lower leaves,\nyou can turn the leaf over and see it from the underside. You’ll see alternating\ndark green and light green stripes, and the leaves will look leathery and\ncurled. Eventually, the leaves wilt, turn yellow and die.\n\nWhat’s really important is that there is a look-alike\n[https://bygl.osu.edu/node/1176], a native beech leaf rolling aphid that appears\nstrikingly similar, but it’s native and doesn’t have an impact on the tree. The\naphid causes yellowing and curling of the leaves, that can be mistaken for BLD.\nBut it’s the banding, or striping of dark green and light green that indicates\nit’s BLD.\n\nWhat should I do if I see it?\nIf you suspect beech leaf disease, you should report it to the Maryland\nDepartment of Agriculture’s Forest Pest unit by emailing them at\nfpm.mda@maryland.gov [fpm.mda@maryland.gov] or call 410.841.5870.\n\nMDA also recommends disinfecting your shoes with a solution of bleach and water\nimmediately after walking through stands of infected trees, so if you think\nyou’ve seen BLD, it would be good to take that extra precautionary step.\n\nIs there anything else people should know about this disease?\nOur society needs to do more about preventing the spread of invasive species. An\nounce of prevention, as they say … . It is not sustainable to invest in control\nafter a species invades. Humans are the No. 1 invasive species. It’s our\nresponsibility, therefore, to steward the lands and prevent and correct the\nspread of invasive species across the landscape."

Photo:\nESA – S. Corvaja.\n\nEurope is facing months without its own independent access to space for large\nsatellites following the retirement of its heavy-lift Ariane 5 rocket this week\nafter notching up its 117th and final mission over 27 years of operations.\n\nAriane 6, the much-heralded successor, is still undergoing final development and\ntesting. It is behind schedule and is unlikely to fly until the very end of this\nyear, with some industry experts suggesting it may not make its maiden flight\nuntil later in 2024.\n\nThe situation for Europe is compounded by its smaller vehicle, the Vega-C,\nremaining out of action following an in-flight failure last December and Russian\nSoyuz rockets no longer being available for European launches. An older version\nof the Vega is scheduled to fly in September.\n\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) director general Josef Aschbacher stated recently\nthat the continent finds itself in the midst of “an acute launcher crisis”\nbecause of the “unavailability of home-grown rockets”.\n\nHe said: “The performance and accuracy of Ariane 5 has been quite unique and it\nwill be remembered as a remarkable vehicle but I’m convinced that Ariane 6 will\nhave the same performance and the same accuracy once it’s on the launch pad.”\n\nAriane 6 was commissioned because the cost of producing the Ariane 5 became\nunsustainable, largely in the face of US competition. It is intended to be at\nleast 40 percent cheaper than the Ariane 5 though it will still be an\n‘expendable’ design.\n\nAriane 6 will be available in two versions depending on the required performance\n– Ariane 62 with two strap-on boosters and Ariane 64 with four.\n\nAriane 62 can launch payloads of approximately 4500 kg into geostationary\ntransfer orbit (GEO) or 10,300 kg into low Earth orbit (LEO), whilst Ariane 64\ncan launch payloads of approximately 11,500 kg into GEO and 20,600 kg into LEO.\nIt will also offer rideshare opportunities for small satellites.\n\nStanding over 60 metres (197 feet) tall, Ariane 6 will weigh almost 900 tonnes\nwhen launched with a full payload – roughly equivalent to one-and-a-half Airbus\nA380 passenger aeroplanes.\n\nFor its development, ESA has been working with an industrial network of several\nhundred companies in 13 European countries, led by prime contractor ArianeGroup.\nThe French space agency, CNES, is preparing the Ariane 6 launch facilities at\nEurope’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.\n\nAriane 6’s lower stage, with solid rocket boosters, will propel the rocket in\nthe first phase of flight, delivering 135 tonnes of thrust in vacuum. The core\nstage is powered by the liquid-fuelled Vulcain 2.1 – an upgraded engine derived\nfrom Ariane 5’s Vulcain 2 – and either two or four P120C boosters to provide\nadditional thrust at liftoff.\n\nThe upper stage is powered by a re-ignitable Vinci engine fuelled by cryogenic\nliquid oxygen and hydrogen. The upper stage, which will allow Ariane 6 to reach\na range of orbits on a single mission, will typically burn one, two or more\ntimes to reach the required orbits. After separation of the payload, there will\nbe a final burn to deorbit the upper stage, to mitigate space debris.\n\nThe ogive-shaped fairing at the top of Ariane 6 will be available in two sizes:\n20 metres (A64/A62) and 14 metre (A62). Both are 5.4 metres (17.7 feet) in\ndiameter and made of carbon fibre-polymer composite. The fairing protects\nsatellites from the thermal, acoustic and aerodynamic stresses on the ascent to\norbit.\n\n[http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230711-Ariane-6.jpg]An\nAriane 6 test vehicle stands on the launch pad at the Guiana Space Centre in\nJune. Image: ESA – M. Pedoussaut.\n\nAriane 6 will be launched from French Guiana from a dedicated launch site 4 km\n(2.5 miles) west of the Ariane 5 launch pad. The main structures comprise the\nLaunch Vehicle Assembly building – used for horizontal integration and\npreparation before rollout to the launch zone – the mobile gantry and launch\npad.\n\nThe mobile gantry – a 90 metre-high (295 feet) mobile metallic structure\nweighing 8200 tonnes when fully equipped – rolls on rails. It is equipped with\nplatforms to give access to the launch vehicle for integration on the launch\npad. It stores and protects Ariane 6 until it is retracted before launch.\n\nDevelopment of Ariane 6 began as a response to the changing landscape of the\nglobal launch market and its go-ahead was approved at the ESA Council at\nMinisterial level meeting in December 2014, a key motivation being to maintain\nEurope’s leadership in the commercial launch service market while also\nresponding to the needs of European independence in accessing and using space.\n\nESA’s role in the development of Ariane 6 has been to oversee the process of\nprocurement, as well as being in charge of the architecture of the overall\nlaunch system. Industry has responsible for identifying commercial market\nrequirements, given its future responsibility in the commercial use of the\nlaunch system.\n\nThe agency’s Director of Space Transportation, Toni Tolker-Nielsen, told\nSpaceflight Now: “Ariane 6 will be more flexible, cost-efficient and will serve\nmore missions than Ariane 5. Several key milestones have to be completed before\na launch date can be confirmed but it is already a commercial success with the\nfirst three production years already sold out.”\n\nLaunch system qualification review tests for all three main systems, the\nlauncher, launch system and launch base, began this summer and an upper stage\nadditional hot firing test is scheduled to take place at DLR Lampoldshausen,\nGermany, later in July.\n\nThis test, on the P5.2 test bench, will simulate a nominal flight profile like\nthe one planned for the inaugural flight, to confirm the expected behaviour of\nthe upper stage. A further test is planned at the end of the summer to examine\nstage behaviour in degraded cases.\n\nIn November the lower and upper stages are scheduled to be transported by sea\nfrom France and Germany to French Guiana in preparation for a full launch\nvehicle assembly test and a wet dress rehearsal."

They wouldn’t come from planets in\nour solar system, but rather far-flung exoplanets that we cannot see up close.\nAmong the possibilities are laser or radio pulses, signs of artificial chemicals\nin the atmospheres of distant planets, or “Dyson spheres” – massive structures\nbuilt around stars to collect their energy.\n\nAnd as acceptance in the scientific community slowly grows, a field once derided\nas a search for “little green men” is showing early signs of blossoming into a\nmature, serious investigation.\n\n“That’s something we’ve worked very hard on: to establish our legitimacy, and\ndistance ourselves from pseudo-science,” said Jill Tarter, an astronomer known\nfor decades as a leader in the search for intelligent life beyond Earth. “If\nanything, my conviction that this is an important and reasonable thing to do has\nincreased.”\n\nTarter is the co-founder and former director of the Center for SETI (Search for\nExtraterrestrial Intelligence) Research at the SETI Institute, as well as the\ninspiration for the main character in Carl Sagan’s 1985 novel “Contact.” She\nsays one of the biggest challenges today is moving the search for signs of\ntechnology beyond just radio signals.\n\n“We still want to look at all the sky all the time, at all wavelengths,” Tarter\nsaid, including pulses of laser light that might be used for communication.\n\n\nTHE LATEST\n\n * [https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcWdiIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--a1393ad3840989e7b025cf6e4e8d3b02d1b7789e/SFL_Story2_Illustration%20640.jpeg]\n   https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1762/life-on-other-planets-what-is-life-and-what-does-it-need/\n\n * [https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcHNiIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--40d06b936fa2efb50a3b59844352d643d71c9620/SFL_1_illo.640.png]\n   https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1761/beginnings-life-on-our-world-and-others/\n\nAnother challenge is short-lived “transient” signals, one-time events that can\nbe bright and energetic. Mixed among the many natural sources for such signals,\nlike gamma-ray bursts or supernovae, might be artificial transients from distant\ncivilizations – an engineered signal lasting less than a few minutes. But\nteasing them apart likely would require enormous amounts of computer time.\n\n“We’re trying to figure out how to do that,” Tarter said. “That is our focus\nnow.”\n\nArtificial intelligence could prove an ally in such searches. Sophisticated\nalgorithms can sort through large amounts of data for patterns that could\nindicate an engineered signal. And AI searches likely would have fewer of the\npossible biases of human analysts, who might tend to focus their search on types\nof signals they’ve defined in advance, or view as more likely.\n\nStretching boundaries in the search for technosignatures is a high priority for\nRavi Kopparapu, a researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,\nMaryland, who specializes in the hunt for habitable worlds as well as\ntechnosignatures.\n\nHe, like Tarter, seeks to define potential signals beyond the radio realm.\n\nIn published work, Kopparapu has explored using “nitrogen dioxide pollution as a\nsignature for technology,” he said. After all, Earth’s pollution levels reflect\nhuman activity. Satellites monitoring our own planet have observed changes, too\n– for example, a temporary dip in such pollution around urban centers during\nCOVID-19 lockdowns.\n\n“I thought, OK, can we use that as a signature of technology another\ncivilization might be using?” he said.\n\nCarbon is the fourth most abundant element in the observable universe, and is\nrelatively reactive, making it a natural candidate for involvement in synthetic\nreactions that any life-form might use. Carbon has formed the basis of life and\nmany technologies on Earth.\n\n“We should expect similar things to happen on other planets,” Kopparapu said.\n“They should be having the same elements we have here; then they could have\ncarbon-based life, carbon-based technology, and fossil fuel technology as well.”\n\nAnother clearly artificial chemical would be chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, once\nheavily used as refrigerants here on Earth. Highly damaging to the planet’s\nprotective ozone layer, they were phased out after the Montreal Protocol\nagreement in the late 1980s. Detection of the chemical in the atmospheres of\nexoplanets – planets around other stars – might be possible under some\nconditions, Kopparapu said.\n\nAnd another phenomenon sometimes considered a form of “pollution,” at least by\nastronomers, is artificial light. Though difficult to observe, capturing the\nglimmer of “city lights” on the night side of a rocky, Earth-sized planet would\nbe a clear sign of at least moderately advanced technology.\n\nOne speculative product of a super-advanced civilization could be “Dyson\nspheres” – megastructures around other stars, as outlined decades ago by the\nlate physicist Freeman Dyson. A hypothetical structure could partially block the\nlight from, say, a mature, Sun-like star, as it gathers the star’s energy. A\nDyson sphere’s presence would be revealed by “waste heat” – observed as excess\ninfrared radiation.\n\n“If the technology is using lots of solar energy, giant solar panels in space\nblocking 1% of the star’s light, there will be a huge, whopping infrared\nsignature,” said Jason Wright, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at Penn\nState who works on a variety of problems involving stars, planets and the\npotential for life in the universe.\n\nTechnosignatures_graphic\n[https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/internal_resources/2765/Technosignatures_graphic.jpeg]\nhttps://exoplanets.nasa.gov/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcndiIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--7e926a35afbca643c462f99dd199b1ce5e8857f4/Technosignatures_graphic.jpeg\nInfographic: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Lizbeth B. De La Torre\n\nInfrared radiation is usually associated with young stars, surrounded by dusty\ndisks where planets are forming. The disks absorb the starlight and emit an\nexcess of telltale infrared light.\n\n\"An old star like the Sun doesn't have any right having that much [infrared]\nemission coming off it,” Wright said.\n\nInvestigations of these and other potential technosignatures have begun to\nproliferate, prompting some NASA astrophysicists to conduct a survey of such\nefforts – and to identify the technologies the investigators might require.\n\nNick Siegler, chief technologist for the Exoplanet Exploration Program at NASA’s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, and his team have so far\ncatalogued more than 40 technosignature investigations by scientists in related\nfields.\n\nThe investigations run from the familiar to the exotic. That includes well-known\nsearches for radio signals as well as novel approaches: looking for strange\ngamma-ray emissions that might indicate highly advanced propulsion systems, or\nlight signatures of large, obviously artificial structures passing in front of –\n“transiting” – their stars.\n\n“Imagine that some ETs, for not a huge price, built a massive triangle,” Siegler\nsaid. “Those don’t naturally appear in the cosmos. The light curve [measurements\nof the star’s brightness over time] of a massive, transiting triangle doesn’t\nlook like a disk.”\n\nHe sees the renewed focus on technosignatures as a natural outgrowth of NASA’s\nbroader search for life beyond Earth. And he says technosignatures, defined as\nevidence of advanced life, are a subset of biosignatures – evidence of all\nbiological life, including microorganisms.\n\n“NASA is fully committed to the search for life being one of its key science\ngoals,” Siegler said. “Technosignatures will be part of the continuum of\nevidence of life we will search for on exoplanets.”\n\nTarter was, in fact, the project scientist for NASA’s former SETI Microwave\nObserving Project and High Resolution Microwave Survey from 1989 to 1993. But\nNASA’s recent, more visible involvement in technosignature searches began with a\nworkshop in Houston in 2018. The organizer, exoplanet researcher Dawn Gelino,\nsays both the number and membership of technosignature working groups have grown\nsince then. And several agency research programs have begun to allow\ntechnosignature proposals.\n\nGelino is deputy director of the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute, and also a\nco-lead for NASA’s Nexus for Exoplanetary System Science (NExSS) research\ncoordination network. She says NExSS’ technosignatures working group is planning\na webinar on the topic in summer 2023. NExSS also supported the NASA-sponsored\n“Technoclimes” online workshop in 2020 to develop a research agenda for\nnon-radio technosignatures.\n\nMore workshops by privately funded groups also are being added to the mix.\n\n“We have to show everyone that technosignatures is a real field of study –\nquantitative, hard science – and needs funding in order to be able to grow and\nbe part of the whole exoplanet ecosystem,” Gelino said.\n\nOne way to grow technosignature studies, Tarter, Siegler and other scientists\nsay, is to “piggyback” on studies of exoplanets and other cosmic phenomena. If a\nspace telescope is already looking at a star for other reasons, the same data\ncan be examined for signs of technosignatures. That would help contain costs\nwhile widening the aperture in the search for signs of technological\ncivilizations.\n\nAnd seeking technosignatures in data beyond radio – chemistry, for example, or\npatterns in absorption and emission of energy – also could broaden the\nscientific basis of technosignature investigations.\n\n“It’s a really exciting time to be in the search,” said Wright, the Penn State\nresearcher. “I think we have a real shot if something’s out there.”"

Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls\n\nWASHINGTON — Vast Space has brought in a former NASA astronaut and SpaceX\nofficial to serve as an adviser for its plans to develop commercial space\nstations.\n\nVast announced July 11 that it has appointed Garrett Reisman as a human\nspaceflight adviser. He will assist the company, which announced plans in May to\ndevelop a single-module station called Haven-1\n[https://spacenews.com/vast-announces-plans-for-first-commercial-space-station/]\nas a precursor for future, larger space stations.\n\nReisman joined NASA’s astronaut corps in 1998 and spent three months on the\nInternational Space Station in 2008 as part of the Expedition 16 and 17 crews,\nand another 12 days on the STS-132 shuttle mission to the ISS in 2010. He\nretired from the astronaut corps in 2011 and worked for SpaceX for several years\nin various capacities, including director of space operations. He is currently a\nprofessor of astronautical engineering at the University of Southern California.\n\nIn an interview, Reisman said a former SpaceX colleague, now working at Vast,\nreached out to him with a technical question. That led to discussions with Vast\nexecutives about assisting the company. “I got excited by what I saw, which was\na really interesting company doing some really cool work,” he said.\n\nHe said he is particularly interested in the ability of Vast’s space stations to\nspin and create artificial gravity. “We have a lot of data at zero G and tons of\ndata at one G about what it does to the human body. We have no idea what happens\nin between,” he said. Those stations, he said, could help answer questions such\nas how much partial gravity is needed to prevent some of the deleterious effects\nof microgravity on human physiology.\n\nMax Haot, president of Vast, said the company was looking for someone intimately\nfamiliar with human spaceflight to assist its development of Haven-1. “The\ncompany had not yet gotten to the point where we had anyone with human\nspaceflight experience, who had gone to space,” he said. “I think it’s obvious\nto everyone that if you design a space station, you should have at least one, if\nnot more, astronauts on board to help you with the process.”\n\nReisman, he said, was an ideal fit because of both his NASA astronaut experience\nand work at SpaceX. Vast is working with SpaceX to launch Haven-1 and use Crew\nDragon spacecraft to transport astronauts to the station.\n\nReisman said he plans to focus on operations and safety. “I think those two\nthings go hand-in-hand,” he said, to “make sure we hope for the best and plan\nfor all possible outcomes.”\n\nSince Vast announced Haven-1 in May, the company has signed an agreement with\nImpulse Space to use thrusters from that company on the spacecraft. It was also\none of seven companies that won unfunded NASA Space Act Agreements to support\nwork on commercial space capabilities\n[https://spacenews.com/nasa-agreements-to-support-work-on-commercial-spacecraft-and-space-stations/].\n\n“This is a great opportunity for us to build the relationship with NASA but also\nleverage a lot of their expertise,” Haot said of that agreement. It also\nincludes “many technology milestones” to track its progress, he noted.\n\nReisman, besides advising Vast, will continue as a senior adviser for SpaceX. He\nsaid that company had no issues with him also advising Vast since the two\ncompanies are working together.\n\nHe also continues his teaching at USC, where he says he sees strong interest\nfrom students in careers in commercial human spaceflight. Some of his students\nhave taken his class on human spaceflight out of a “vague interest” in the topic\nbut have since gone on to pursue careers in the field.\n\n“In a way I’m very jealous because it’s such a wonderful time to be working in\nthis industry,” he said. “Coming as an engineer straight out of college there’s\nso many opportunities now that I didn’t have when I was finishing up my\neducation.”\n\n[https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jeff_foust-1-150x150.jpg?is-pending-load=1]\n\nJeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for\nSpaceNews.

In\npeople with distance visual impartment, that jumped to 19.5%; 21.5% for near\nvisual impairment; and 32.9% for people who had moderate to severe visual\nimpairment or were blind, according to the study.\n\nThe study showed that even mild vision impairment can increase risk, said Dr.\nArielle Silverman, director of research at the American Foundation for the\nBlind. Silverman was not involved in the research.\n\nAnd the increase for moderate and severe impairment was significant.\n\n“The potential to increase your risk by two and a half times because of vision\nimpairment is quite stark,” said Dr. Thomas Holland, a physician scientist at\nthe Rush Institute for Healthy Aging and an instructor of internal medicine at\nRush Medical College in Chicago. Holland was not involved in the study.\n\nIt is important to note that because of the way this study was designed, the\nresearch team can’t know for sure that the vision impairment caused the\ndementia, only that they were correlated.\n\nDementia could be causing the vision loss, or they could just be happening at\nthe same time, Ehrlich said.\n\nThere is a similar correlation between hearing loss and dementia\n[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(23)00048-8/fulltext],\nhe added. It may be that the impairments decrease the input of our senses, which\ncould lead to some confusion that can speed up cognitive decline, Holland said.\n\n“If you can’t feel something and know that you are injuring yourself, you’re\ngoing to get hurt. That just is the name of the game. And then the same thing\nwhen it comes to your hearing and your vision,” he added.\n\nAnother factor that might lead to the correlation is a possible decrease in\nopportunities and community participation that could come with vision loss,\nSilverman said.\n\nWhat should you do about it? Keep on top of vision care, Ehrlich said.\n\nIn addition to living a healthy lifestyle, having annual visits and vision\nchecks are important, Holland added.\n\nAnd if a problem is found, get it taken care of, Ehrlich said.\n\n“When it comes to vision impairment and blindness, an estimated 80 plus percent\nis either preventable or even reversible,” he added.\n\nAfter an examination, your eye doctor may recommend a corrective procedure like\nLASIK or cataract surgery, or it could be as simple as wearing prescription\nglasses, Holland said.\n\nWhen it comes to dementia, preventive measures are important, and taking care of\nyour senses is an easy way to take care of your cognition, Ehrlich said.\n\n“The earlier the better,” Holland said. “If you notice that you have vision that\nis starting to be impaired, get it checked out.”\n\nBut not every case of vision loss is treatable. That is why it is important to\npair vision preventive health with rehabilitation services “so that people who\nbecome blind or have low vision can continue to live their lives actively with\nchoice, independence and confidence,” Silverman said.\n\nThat could mean building skills so that people who are blind can continue to\nmove independently and safely through the world, engage with hobbies, and do\nother things that are crucial for cognitive health, she added.\n\n“Aging is hard, but vision is something we have a lot of supports for,”\nSilverman said. “If your vision cannot be corrected, seek a referral to a vision\nrehabilitation therapist for strategies to work with the vision you do have, and\nnon-visual techniques to keep engaged in all aspects of your life.”\n\nEditor’s Note: Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made\nsimple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools\ndesigned to improve your well-being\n[https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/life-but-better?source=nl-acq_article]."

        "content": "How many times have you heard that it’s best to eat “whole” foods or to avoid\n“processed” ones? There’s even a system that designates some foods as\n“ultra-processed,” which calls to mind chemical concoctions made in a lab that\nwe should do our best to avoid. But as I’ve written before, the degree to which\na food is “processed” doesn’t tell you how healthy it is\n[https://lifehacker.com/lets-stop-calling-foods-ultra-processed-1850067013]. And\nnow scientists at the USDA have taken steps toward proving that.\n\n\n\nWHAT IS AN ULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD?\n\n“Ultra-processed” is not a category based on nutrition. It’s based on the NOVA\nscale, which counts a food as ultra-processed if it includes additives you\nwouldn’t find in a home kitchen, or if it’s sold in a ready-to-eat state. This\nresults in some nonsensical contradictions: Liquor is ultra-processed, but wine\nis not. A burger is ultra-processed, but a steak with a roll on the side is\nnot—even if those two meals are made with the same exact ingredients.\n\nAnd the truth is, a lot of foods that we buy at the grocery store meet the\ndefinition of “ultra-processed,” even if they have relatively few ingredients\nand are good sources of protein, veggies, whole grains, or other things that we\nshould be getting more of. So scientists at the USDA created a three-day menu\nthat meets nearly all the dietary guidelines\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623724346?via%3Dihub]\n(as in, it’s better than what most of us eat on a daily basis) out of\ningredients that can almost all be found in the “ultra-processed” NOVA category.\n\nBy the way, even though fitfluencers like to pooh-pooh the Dietary Guidelines\nfor Americans, they’re actually a pretty solid structure for building a healthy\ndiet. We have a rundown of the 2020 guidelines here\n[https://lifehacker.com/hey-the-2020-usda-dietary-guidelines-are-finally-out-1845970070]\n(they’re updated every five years, so that’s the current edition) and it\nincludes hard-to-argue-with statements like:\n\n> The core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include:\n> \n> • Vegetables of all types—dark green; red and orange; beans, peas, and\n> lentils; starchy; and other vegetables\n> \n> • Fruits, especially whole fruit\n> \n> • Grains, at least half of which are whole grain\n> \n> • Dairy, including fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese, and/or\n> lactose-free versions and fortified soy beverages and yogurt as alternatives\n> \n> • Protein foods, including lean meats, poultry, and eggs; seafood; beans,\n> peas, and lentils; and nuts, seeds, and soy products\n> \n> • Oils, including vegetable oils and oils in food, such as seafood and nuts\n\n\nWHAT ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS CAN BE IN A HEALTHY DIET?\n\nSo what does a healthy diet made of ultra-processed food look like? The USDA’s\nsample menu\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623724346] includes:\n\n * A breakfast burrito made with canned beans, liquid egg whites, shredded\n   cheese, and a store-bought tortilla\n * Instant oatmeal with raisins\n * Store-bought salsa and guacamole\n * A sandwich made with deli turkey on wheat bread\n * Strawberry yogurt\n * Rotisserie chicken\n * Orange juice\n * Ultra-filtered milk (like Fairlife)\n\nAll told, 91% of the calories came from foods that NOVA considers to be\nultra-processed. (You can see all the meals here\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623724346].) And when\nrating it in terms of what would count as a “healthy” diet, the sample menu met\nmost criteria. It had slightly higher sodium than is ideal, and not enough of\nthe grains were whole grains--so it’s not perfect, but it’s darn close. In\nconclusion, the scientists write, “Healthy dietary patterns can include most of\ntheir energy from UPF [ultra-processed foods], still receive a high diet quality\nscore, and contain adequate amounts of most macro- and micronutrients.” So\nfitfluencers and diet gurus should relax. But we already knew that.\n"

Digestion creates heat, and consuming large amounts of rich\nfoods in one sitting can be difficult for the body to break down, said Leigh A.\nFrame\n[https://apps.smhs.gwu.edu/smhs/facultydirectory/profile.cfm?empName=Leigh%20Frame&FacID=2075162956],\ndirector of integrative medicine at George Washington University. “If you’re\nstruggling to digest food, your body’s actually creating more heat.”\n\nEating a heavy meal when it’s really hot out can also make you feel more\nsluggish and tired because your body is trying to do too much at once, said\nCecilia Sorensen\n[https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/cecilia-j-sorensen-md], director\nof the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education at Columbia University.\n\nInstead, experts recommend eating lighter meals more frequently throughout the\nday and focusing on hydrating foods that can be easier to digest, such as\ncucumber and watermelon.\n\n“That is going to make people have more energy and not feel as fatigued during\nthe heat,” Sorensen said.\n\nConsume too much caffeine. Drinks with large amounts of caffeine, such as energy\ndrinks\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/11/prime-energy-drink-concerns-caffeine/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13],\ncan be dehydrating because they make you urinate more.\n\n“It depends on the amount of caffeine in them. For instance, the amount of\ncaffeine in a cup of coffee is not that much,” Frame said.\n\nThink ice-cold foods and drinks are the solution. Cooling down on a hot day with\nice cream, Popsicles or an icy drink might give you temporary relief.\n\n“It’s not like you can be out in the hot, hot sun, and humidity and just eat\ncold foods and be okay,” said Nate Wood\n[https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/nathan-wood/], a chef and instructor of\nmedicine at the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nAnd consuming a lot of cold foods or drinks in a single day could lower your\ncore temperature, Frame said. Your body might respond by trying to heat itself\nback up, which could drain your energy and make you feel warmer in the long run,\nshe said. Additionally, most ice cream contains dairy, which can be difficult\nfor many people to digest.\n\n“It would be better to use a cold compress on the back of your neck rather than\ntrying to ice yourself from the inside out,” she said.\n\nDO ...\n\nEat fruits and vegetables. Food can be a major source of hydration. Unlike\nprocessed foods, which typically don’t contain much water and can be harder to\ndigest, many fruits and vegetables are full of water and nutrition.\n\nExperts recommend eating produce with high water content, such as berries,\nwatermelon, cucumbers, tomatoes, celery and bell peppers. While lettuce is known\nto contain a lot of water, Wood said darker greens such as kale and spinach can\nalso be hydrating.\n\nThese foods have the added benefit that they don’t need to be cooked\n[https://washpost.arcpublishing.com/ellipsis/washingtonpost.com/food/2021/07/05/no-cook-recipes-summer/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28],\nso you can reduce the amount of heat generated inside your home.\n\nScientists say to brace for more extreme weather and possibly a record-warm 2023\namid unprecedented temperatures. (Video: John Farrell/The Washington Post)\n\nHydrate properly. Plain water and low-sugar, caffeine-free drinks are ideal,\nexperts say. Unless you’re playing a sport or exercising, you probably don’t\nneed an electrolyte drink, which often has added sugar.\n\nBut it’s important to be careful to avoid drinking too much water. Guzzling\nwater could cause a potentially fatal condition known as hyponatremia\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyponatremia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373711],\nwhich occurs when the sodium in your body becomes diluted and levels drop\nabnormally low.\n\nAside from feeling thirsty, the best way to know if you’re properly hydrated is\nto assess the color of your urine, Frame said. “If it is a very pale yellow,\nlike the color of light lemon juice, you are hydrated. If it is any darker than\nthat, then you are dehydrated.”\n\nThink about balance. Avoid making drastic changes to your diet, experts said.\n\nBeyond hydration, your body needs calories. Supplement hydrating foods with\nthings that are higher in unsaturated or healthy fats and lean proteins, Wood\nsaid.\n\nKeep in mind that if you suddenly start eating more fruits and vegetables than\nyou have before, your body could react poorly, he said. For example, eating way\nmore fiber than you’re used to could cause gastrointestinal issues such as\nbloating and cramping and changes to your bowel movements, he said.\n\n“One of the best things people can do is just kind of like start adopting these\ntypes of lifestyle and dietary modifications chronically, because these are\nhealthy for us anyway,” Wood said. “Then, when the time comes where that becomes\nreally important for literal survival, if not just comfort, you’re kind of\nalready acclimated to doing those things and it’s not such a shock to the body.”"

        "content": "A meta-analytic review of previous studies indicates that obese individuals have\nan increased risk of depression and that this relationship isn’t just\ncorrelational — obesity might be one of the causes of depression. The\nresearchers argue that the increased occurrence of depression in the population\nin recent decades might be at least partly due to the increase in obesity. The\nstudy was published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research\n[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.05.034].\n\nObesity is a medical condition where a person has too much body fat. It is\ndetermined by calculating a person’s body mass index (BMI) using their height\nand weight. Obesity is associated with several health problems like heart\ndisease, diabetes, certain cancers, and musculoskeletal disorders. The number of\nobese individuals in the population has been increasing rapidly in recent years.\n\nA similar trend of increase in the same period has been observed for depression,\na mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness,\nhopelessness, and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities. Studies have\nshown that individuals with obesity also have an increased risk of depression.\nAcross a number of studies, obese individuals had a 55% higher risk of\ndepression compared to the non-obese. The question that remains is whether\nobesity predisposes one to develop depression.\n\nTo answer this question, Markus Jokela and Michael Laakasuo from the University\nof Helsinki in Finland examined potential effects of increasing obesity rates on\nhow common depression is in the population. To this end, they reviewed the\nresults of studies that used a method called Mendelian randomization. They also\nanalyzed data from two ongoing national surveys conducted in the United States\nand the United Kingdom.\n\nIn a Mendelian Randomization study, researchers use genetic information to\nunderstand if a certain behavior or a trait (body mass index in this case)\nactually causes a specific outcome (depression). They look for genetic markers\nthat are related to the behavior or trait studied and see if those markers are\nalso related to the outcome. This helps them determine if there is a real\ncause-and-effect relationship between the exposure and the outcome.\n\nAfter inspecting 539 different studies, the researchers found eight Mendelian\nrandomization studies that contained the data they were looking for. The results\nfrom these studies showed that obese individuals had a higher risk of depression\ncompared to non-obese individuals. Across these samples, individuals with higher\nBMI values, regardless of whether its value indicated obesity or not, had a\nhigher risk of depression.\n\nThe researchers then compared the findings from these studies to data collected\nfrom the Health Survey for England, which began in 1991, and the U.S. National\nHealth Interview Survey, conducted since 1957. These surveys collected\ninformation on psychological distress levels and asked participants about their\nheight and weight. (Psychological distress is a broad measure of mental health\nthat includes symptoms of depression but also anxiety and somatic complaints.)\n\nThe researchers looked at the changes in psychological distress and obesity\nlevels reported by these surveys between 1991 and 2016 and predicted the changes\nin psychological distress that would be expected if obesity caused depression,\ngiven the changes in population obesity rates in this period. The predictions\nwere based on the findings about the relationship between obesity and depression\nreported by the Mendelian randomization studies they analyzed.\n\nThe researchers found that, as the percentage of obese individuals has doubled\nsince the 1990s, that could have contributed to a half percentage increase in\nthe prevalence of psychological distress. In England, it would explain an\nincrease in the share of people reporting psychological distress from 15.7% to\n16.3% between 1991 and 2016 and from 19.4% to 20% in the U.S. in the period\nbetween 1997 and 2016.\n\n“In sum, obesity seems to be a causal risk factor for depression, increasing its\nodds by 33%. Between 15% and 20% of the general population are estimated to\nsuffer from at least moderate psychological distress. The doubling of obesity\nprevalence from the 1990s–2010s would have increased this prevalence [of\npsychological distress] by one-half percentage points,” the study authors\nconcluded.\n\nThe study makes a valuable contribution to the scientific systematization of\nknowledge about the relationship between obesity and depression. However, it\nalso has limitations that need to be taken into account. Notably, the study only\nfocused on depression, while it relied on a broader mental health indicator from\nnational surveys – psychological distress. It also did not consider other mental\nhealth consequences of obesity, such as reduced risk of suicide.\n\nThe study, “Obesity as a causal risk factor for depression: Systematic review\nand meta-analysis of Mendelian Randomization studies and implications for\npopulation mental health [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.05.034]”,\nwas authored by Markus Jokela and Michael Laakasuo."

A detailed description of the\ndecipherment has now been published in the journal Transactions of the\nPhilological Society under the title \"A Partial Decipherment of the Unknown\nKushan Script.\"\n\n\nNEW DISCOVERY LED TO BREAKTHROUGH\n\nThe unknown Kushan script is a writing system that was in use in parts of\nCentral Asia between about 200 BCE and 700 CE. It can be associated with both\nthe early nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppe, such as the Yuèzhī, and the\nruling dynasty of the Kushans. The Kushans founded an empire which, among other\nthings, was responsible for the spread of Buddhism to East Asia. They also\ncreated monumental architecture and artworks.\n\nSo far, several dozen mostly short inscriptions are known, most of them\noriginating from the territory of the present-day states of Tajikistan,\nAfghanistan and Uzbekistan. There is also a longer trilingual that was found by\nFrench archaeologists in the 1960s at Dašt-i Nāwur in Afghanistan: on a boulder\nat 4,320 m altitude on Mount Qarabayu, approximately 100 km southwest of Kabul.\n\nThe writing system was has been known since the 1950s, but had never been\nsuccessfully deciphered. In 2022, a short bilingual was found carved into a rock\nface in the Almosi Gorge in northwestern Tajikistan, approximately 30 km from\nthe capital Dushanbe. In addition to the unknown Kushan script, it also contains\na section in the already known Bactrian language.\n\nThis discovery led to renewed attempts by several researchers to decode the\nscript—independently of one another. In the end, the linguists at the University\nof Cologne succeeded in partially deciphering the writing system in\ncollaboration with the Tajik archaeologist Dr. Bobomullo Bobomulloev, who was\ninstrumental in the discovery and documentation of the bilingual.\n\n\nSUCCESS 200 YEARS AFTER THE DECIPHERING OF THE EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHS\n\nThe team applied a methodology based on the way unknown scripts have been\ndeciphered in the past, i.e., the Egyptian hieroglyphs using the Rosetta Stone,\nancient Persian cuneiform script or Greek Linear B script: Thanks to the known\ncontent of the bilingual inscription found in Tajikistan (Bactrian and unknown\nKushan script) and the trilingual inscription from Afghanistan (Gandhari or\nMiddle Indo-Aryan, Bactrian and unknown Kushan script), Bonmann, Halfmann and\nKorobzow were able to gradually draw conclusions about the type of writing and\nlanguage.\n\nThe breakthrough was finally made possible by the royal name Vema Takhtu, which\nappeared in both Bactrian parallel texts, and the title \"King of Kings,\" which\ncould be identified in the corresponding sections in the unknown Kushan script.\nThe title especially proved to be a good indicator of the underlying language.\nStep by step, using the Bactrian parallel text, the linguists were able to\nanalyze further character sequences and determine the phonetic values of\nindividual characters.\n\n\nKEY TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF KUSHAN CULTURE\n\nAccording to the research group, the Kushan script recorded a completely unknown\nMiddle Iranian language, which is neither identical to Bactrian nor to the\nlanguage known as Khotanese Saka, which was once spoken in western China. The\nlanguage probably occupies a middle position in the development between these\nlanguages. It could be either the language of the settled population of northern\nBactria (on a part of the territory of today's Tajikistan) or the language of\ncertain nomadic peoples of Inner Asia (the Yuèzhī), who originally lived in\nnorthwestern China.\n\nFor a certain period of time, it apparently served as one of the official\nlanguages of the Kushan Empire alongside Bactrian, Gandhari/Middle Indo-Aryan\nand Sanskrit. As a preliminary name, the researchers propose the term\n\"Eteo-Tocharian\" to describe the newly identified Iranian language.\n\nThe group is planning future research trips to Central Asia in close cooperation\nwith Tajik archaeologists, as new finds of further inscriptions are to be\nexpected and promising potential sites have already been located. First author\nSvenja Bonmann remarked, \"Our decipherment of this script can help enhance our\nunderstanding of the language [https://phys.org/tags/language/] and cultural\nhistory of Central Asia and the Kushan Empire, similar to the deciphering of the\nEgyptian hieroglyphs or Mayan glyphs for our understanding of ancient Egypt or\nMayan civilization.\"\n\nMore information: Svenja Bonmann et al, A Partial Decipherment of the Unknown\nKushan Script, Transactions of the Philological Society (2023).

The data from the agency’s\nannual report, published in late April, represents “apparent” consumption of\nalcohol because it is inferred from alcohol sales data by state, as opposed to\ntraditional survey data.\n\nThe drinking patterns reported by the NIAAA varied significantly by state. In\nnine states — including Florida, Tennessee and New Jersey — alcohol consumption\nincreased by at least 10 percent.\n\nThe NIAAA data suggests that increased alcohol consumption may be more\npronounced than previously believed. The 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and\nHealth indicated that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults of drinking age reported\ndrinking the same or less than they did before the pandemic.\n\nResearchers say this type of survey data can mask risky behavior or changes in\ndrinking habits because respondents often underreport their alcohol use.\n\nALCOHOL-RELATED DEATHS INCREASED IN EVERY STATE\n\nAs alcohol use was surging, so were alcohol-related deaths. Between 2018 and\n2021, deaths caused by alcohol increased in every state, according to CDC\nmortality data.\n\nSome states that had some of the biggest increases in consumption also had some\nof the largest spikes in alcohol-related death rates. In Mississippi, the rate\nof deaths caused by alcohol more than doubled in a four-year span, rising from 7\ndeaths per 100,000 residents to about 18 deaths per 100,000 in 2021.\n\n“The costs of alcohol abuse and dependence are phenomenal,” said Jefferson\nParker, a professor of psychiatry who co-directs a new addiction treatment\nprogram at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, which last fall\nreceived a $6 million federal grant to help treat alcohol use disorder, along\nwith opioid addiction.\n\nNew Mexico had more than 51 deaths per 100,000 residents, the highest rate of\nalcohol-related deaths in the country, and an increase of almost 50 percent from\nits rate in 2018. Death rates related to alcohol also nearly doubled in Montana,\nSouth Dakota and Delaware during that time.\n\nMany different underlying diseases or conditions involving alcohol could cause\ndeath. Between 2018 and 2021, the rate of Americans dying from alcoholic\ncirrhosis of the liver, the leading alcohol-related cause of death, grew by 42\npercent, while deaths stemming from alcohol dependence or harmful use disorders\nincreased by 54 percent.\n\nYounger drinkers saw the biggest increase in the rate of alcohol-related deaths,\nwhich spiked by nearly 80 percent among 25-to-44-year-olds, a Washington Post\nanalysis of CDC data found. For every 100,000 people that age, 12 people died of\nalcohol-related issues in 2021, the analysis found.\n\nOlder age groups didn’t see rises that dramatic but already had high rates.\nPeople between the ages of 55 and 64 had the highest rate of alcohol-related\ndeaths, at 42 per 100,000.\n\nThose findings add to similarly grim statistics. A CDC study published last fall\nestimated\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2798004?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=110122]\nthat between 2015 and 2019, excessive alcohol use was to blame for 1 in 8 deaths\nof Americans between the ages of 20 and 64.\n\nDRIVEN BY SPIRITS SALES AND LOOSENING OF RULES\n\nThe pandemic spike was notably driven by sales of spirits, which rose nearly 17\npercent compared with less than 1 percent for both wine and beer.\n\nIn Rhode Island, where Logan and Gazerro live in the town of Warwick, the state\nranked third in terms of relative increases in spirits sales since 2018.\n\nFor Gazerro, a podcaster and consultant, his drinking escalated in his 30s and\ngot worse during the boredom of pandemic shutdowns. There was a liquor store a\nfew blocks from his apartment. The pandemic also spurred lawmakers in Rhode\nIsland, among other states, to allow restaurants to sell takeout alcohol. Rhode\nIsland has since made\n[https://www.wpri.com/news/politics/bill-that-would-permanently-allow-to-go-alcohol-sales-heads-to-mckees-desk/]\nthe measure permanent.\n\nThe growth of the spirits industry has been pronounced, helped by the popularity\nof luxury brands and ones backed by celebrities — think tequila brands launched\nby actors such as Dwayne Johnson or Mark Wahlberg. The Distilled Spirits Council\nof the United States reports that in 2022, the spirits revenue market share\n(42.9 percent) eclipsed that of beer (41.9 percent) for the first time. The\ncouncil’s president recently called it a “great American success story,”\naccording to CNBC\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/16/liquor-industry-trends-as-spirits-take-market-share-from-beer.html].\n\nThe council cites changing consumer tastes toward high-end products, plus\nready-to-drink beverages such as hard seltzers, and the proliferation of craft\ndistilleries, which number more than 2,600 today.\n\nDuring the pandemic, consumers who weren’t spending on vacations or restaurants\ninstead spent on luxury spirits they could stock at home, said Amanda Berger,\nthe council’s vice president of science and health.\n\n“The majority of adults who choose to drink do so responsibly, and we have seen\ndecreases in harmful drinking (including binge drinking and underage drinking)\nfor more than a decade,” she said.\n\nWhile the share of Americans under 35 that report binge drinking decreased by\nabout 20 percent between 2011 and 2021, binge drinking has remained at about 18\npercent among 35-to-54-year-olds over the decade and increased by about 13\npercent for those over 55, according to survey data from the CDC’s Behavioral\nRisk Factor Surveillance System.\n\nALCOHOL HAS BECOME MORE AFFORDABLE\n\nCritics have long pointed to the affordability of alcohol as a driving force\nbehind increases in consumption.\n\nCongress last raised the federal alcohol tax in 1991. State taxes vary widely\nbut have generally been stagnant, said Philip J. Cook\n[https://sanford.duke.edu/profile/philip-j-cook/], an economist and professor\nemeritus at Duke University, who has studied alcohol taxes and consumption.\nCongress helped the industry more recently, slashing federal taxes on certain\nalcohol producers in 2017, changes made permanent three years later.\n\n“Alcoholic beverages are cheaper today than they were in the 1980s, relative to\nthe value of the dollar,” Cook said.\n\nPublic health officials say the cost to society is dire.\n\nIn Massachusetts, for example, a Boston University School of Public Health\nreport\n[https://www.bu.edu/sph/files/2022/12/BUSPH_Alcohol-Health-and-Safety-in-Massachusetts.pdf]\nin December found that the state’s excise taxes have lost 72 percent of their\nvalue since 1980, when they were last raised, amounting to less than a nickel\nper drink.\n\n“This is the cheapest and most available drug to American adults,” said David H.\nJernigan, a Boston University professor of health law and a critic of alcohol\nindustry marketing.\n\nIn 2020, Massachusetts state alcohol tax revenue was just $78.6 million,\naccording to the report. Meanwhile, researchers estimated that in 2010, the last\nyear for which data was available, excessive alcohol use cost the state $5.6\nbillion in lost productivity, health care, criminal justice and other areas.\n\nBerger, on the spirits council, disputed the criticism, saying that the spirits\nindustry is one of the country’s most “heavily taxed and regulated industries”\nin the United States and that those who abuse alcohol aren’t deterred by higher\nprices. She said in a statement that tax hikes unfairly raise the cost on\n“responsible consumers” and hurt hospitality businesses still reeling from the\npandemic.\n\nIncreasing taxes remains a tough sell. An effort\n[https://www.wweek.com/news/2023/03/29/the-death-of-a-proposed-beer-and-wine-tax-highlights-vast-differences-in-oregons-taxes-on-intoxicants/#:~:text=Beer%2C%20cider%20and%20wine%20producers,resulting%20in%20an%20indirect%20tax.]\nto increase taxes on beer and wine in Oregon earlier this year fizzled, and last\nmonth, its governor dropped\n[https://www.thechronicleonline.com/news/fee-dropped-50-cent-surcharge-on-alcohol-for-mental-health-services-nixed/article_effcb5dc-0fae-11ee-907a-4b8c4f498b3c.html]\na request to the state’s alcohol commission to impose a 50-cent surcharge on\nbottles of liquor.\n\nIn Massachusetts, liberal Democrats have introduced legislation that would\ndouble the excise tax on alcohol products, which could raise up to an additional\n$89.5 million to be used for substance use education and treatment. But chances\nof the bill passing are not good — Rep. Kay Khan (D) has introduced a similar\nbill for years to no avail.\n\n“It’s sort of a sacred cow,” Khan said. “It’s hard to get people to pay\nattention.”\n\nSOME ARE RETHINKING THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH ALCOHOL\n\nKoob, the director of the NIAAA, is hopeful about the future. He points out that\nmany Americans are nevertheless rethinking their relationship with alcohol, as\nnew research has also punctured the myth that drinking alcohol in moderate\namounts is good for one’s health.\n\nThere’s been a noted decrease in alcohol consumption by underage drinkers, as\nwell as the recognition of dry Januarys and the rising popularity of\nnonalcoholic alternatives, he said.\n\nFor Logan and Gazerro, they’ve been sober for more than a year, although it\nhasn’t been easy. “I loved everything about alcohol. It’s like an old friend I\nhaven’t gotten to hang out with in a while,” Gazerro said.\n\nLogan quit alcohol for her health — and to support her husband. But the cultural\nallure was strong. They felt awkward being out at nightclubs without a drink. So\nthey started the Rhode Island Non-Alcoholic Beer Society, a networking group\n[https://www.facebook.com/groups/rinabs].\n\nSaid Logan, “I wanted people to be able to find restaurants that serve\nnonalcoholic beer, and stores that carried different varieties within the\nstate.”"

        "content": "During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most misunderstood\ncomplications children were experiencing was MIS-C\n[https://abcnews.go.com/Health/holiday-covid-19-surge-blame-rising-mis-cases/story?id=75928794].\n\nMIS-C, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, is a condition in which\ndifferent body parts can become inflamed -- such as the heart, lungs, brain and\nkidneys -- and is often seen in children after they are diagnosed with COVID-19,\naccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n[https://www.cdc.gov/mis/mis-c.html].\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, there have been 9,499 reported cases of MIS-C\nand 79 deaths, CDC data\n[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#mis-national-surveillance] shows.\nCases especially skyrocketed during the first year of the pandemic.\n\nSince then, however, MIS-C cases have dropped dramatically and have almost\ndisappeared entirely. Experts told ABC News they are not sure why this is but\nthere are probably multiple reasons, including more children being immune to\nCOVID-19, as well as newer variants causing less severe complications.\n\n\"It is definitely a medical mystery,\" Dr. Elizabeth Schlaudecker, medical\ndirector of Cincinnati Children's division of infectious diseases, told ABC\nNews. \"We haven't figured it out yet. We're still working on it.\"\n\n\nWHAT IS MIS-C AND HOW IS IT TREATED?\n\nMIS-C is an inflammatory condition that is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2,\nthe virus that causes COVID-19. It typically occurs between two to six weeks\nafter infection and presents a combination of symptoms, including inflammation\nof various parts of the body along with gastrointestinal symptoms, rash and\nfever.\n\nDoctors are unclear about what causes some children to develop MIS-C but believe\nit may involve a genetic predisposition for inflammation in response to\nrespiratory diseases.\n\nPHOTO: Weekly MIS-C Cases in the United States\n[https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/Weekly_MiS-C_Cases_in_the_US_v02_dnl_1689173575278_hpEmbed_1x1_992.jpg]\n\nWeekly MIS-C Cases in the United States\n\nCDC\n\nMost children with MIS-C end up hospitalized and, if they are sick enough, can\nspend time in intensive care units.\n\n\"It's reassuring that for the most part kids do much, much better than adults\nwhen it comes to SARS-CoV-2 infection,\" Dr. Samuel Dominguez, associate\nprofessor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Colorado, told ABC News. \"But\nthere are a subset of kids who can have serious disease related to SARS-CoV-2,\nand probably the most severe for that is MIS-C.\"\n\n\"These kids are gonna be very sick. Half of the kids that we saw ended up in our\nICU and so I think that's an important point that MIS-C definitely is not a\nbenign disease,\" Dr. Dominguez added.\n\nThere are several treatments for MIS-C including anti-inflammatory medications,\nas well as intravenous immunoglobulin, a therapy made up of antibodies to help\nfight infections and reduce inflammation.\n\n\nWHY MIS-C CASES HAVE GONE UP AND DOWN\n\nDuring the first two years of the pandemic, doctors said cases of MIS-C were\nrising rapidly around the country. During the week of Jan. 21, 2021, there were\n261 diagnosed MIS-C cases, CDC data shows.\n\nAs of the week ending Feb. 15, 2023 – the latest period for which data is\navailable – there were just ten cases across the U.S.\n\n\"We had a protocol and an algorithm that we followed at our hospital, like many\nother hospitals, and if there was concern that a patient had MIS-C, back in the\nearly days from 2020 through 2021, we would get a phone call on our infectious\ndisease service,\" said Dr. Schlaudecker.\n\n\"And we were receiving many phone calls a week evaluating children's MIS-C and\ntreating children for MIS-C,\" Dr. Schlaudecker continued. \"And now, it's almost\nunheard of. I can't remember the last time we got a call with any concerns for\nof MIS-C. So, that's really good news.\"\n\nExperts told ABC News that a combination of immunity from infection and\nvaccination has probably lowered the MIS-C risk among children.\n\n\"The majority of children at this point in the United States have some immunity\nto COVID-19,\" Dr. Schlaudecker said. \"Many have been infected and others have\nbeen vaccinated, and some have been infected and vaccinated and are therefore\nimmune. So, I'm imagining that that has something to do with it.\"\n\nCDC data\n[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#nationwide-blood-donor-seroprevalence-2022]\nshows an estimated 91.9% of Americans between ages 6 months and 17 years have\nantibodies due to previous COVID-19 infection. From infection and vaccination,\nthe percentage increases to 96.3%.\n\nAs of May 10, 61.8% of those aged 12 to 17 have completed a primary series of\nvaccinations in addition to 32.9% of those aged five to 11, 6.1% of those aged 2\nto 4, and 4.7% of those under age 2, according to CDC data\n[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends]. No\nage group has surpassed 10% vaccinated when it comes to completing an updated\nbivalent booster.\n\nAdditionally, experts said the COVID-19 variants currently circulating in the\nU.S. may be causing less severe disease than the variants that were more\nprevalent in the earlier months of the pandemic.\n\n\"The delta variant surged in the summer of 2021 and continued into the early\nfall of 2021, [and] clearly contributed to more MIS-C cases than we saw with any\nother variants,\" Dr. James Versalovic, pathologist-in-chief and chair of Texas\nChildren's Hospital's department of pathology, told ABC News. \"Many of us are\nconvinced that there's something regarding the immunogenicity, or the way the\nhuman immune system responded to different variants, that put more children at\nrisk for MIS-C with the delta variant than we saw before the delta variant and\nsince the delta variant waned in late 2021.\"\n\nHe added that even though the omicron variant led to the biggest surge of cases\nseen in the United States since the pandemic began, it didn't translate into\nmore MIS-C cases.\n\n\"At our peak at this hospital we were seeing up to two to three cases per day in\n2021 with delta and MIS-C,\" Dr. Versalovic said. \"With omicron, it was really\nnever more than one case per day and often times it will be several days between\na single case of MIS-C.\"\n\n\"What we've seen is, as the omicron subvariants have shifted, we've even seen\ncases drop even further and now, it may be three or four months between cases,\nand we've seen little to no MIS-C in 2023,\" he continued.\n\n\nVACCINATION IS THE BEST FORM OF PROTECTION\n\nHowever, the doctors who spoke with ABC News warned that just because MIS-C\ncases have dropped noticeably doesn't mean that the threat is gone. Another\nhighly infectious subvariant could lead to a surge in cases.\n\nPHOTO: An adult takes a sick child's temperature in an undated stock photo.\n[https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/sick-1-gty-er-230712_1689176424812_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg]\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\n\"Parents need to continue to remain vigilant…and we continue to strongly\nrecommend bivalent COVID vaccine for children six months of age and above,\" Dr.\nVersalovic said.\n\nHe also recommended that parents consider other interventions, including masking\nin places such as airplanes, to lower the risk of COVID-19.\n\nUltimately, it's also important to recognize the signs of MIS-C and to seek\nmedical care if necessary.\n\n\"If kids have prolonged fever, or with sort of any of these other symptoms –\nsevere abdominal pain, red eyes, rash, red lips – those would be indications to\nseek medical attention to try to find out what's going on,\" Dr. Dominguez said."

Heather\nwanted to go to Oregon for one reason: she wanted to die.\n\nOregon had legalized\n[https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ph/providerpartnerresources/evaluationresearch/deathwithdignityact/pages/faqs.aspx]\nphysician-assisted suicide for patients with a terminal illness (also known as\nmedical aid in dying, or Maid) in 1997, and Heather, who had suffered with an\nintractable chronic illness for over 30 years, knew her illness was going to\nkill her.\n\n“Death is coming for me,” Heather said. “It’s coming for me, Mom.”\n\nDoctors had prophesied Heather’s potential mortality for years. “If you keep\ndoing what you’re doing, you’ll end up in hospice,” said one. They meant it as a\nwarning, but Heather remained impervious to the words. I’m fine, Mom, she\nreassured Jennifer.\n\nFive years later, however, as her illness worsened, hospice sounded like a haven\nfor her last days. But when the 48-year-old tried to find a hospice program in\nher native Tucson, she was rebuffed. Heather didn’t have a terminal illness,\ndoctors said. Her condition was treatable. All she had to do was eat.\n\nTo her mom, this was laughable. Anorexia\n[https://www.theguardian.com/society/anorexia] and bulimia had consumed\nHeather’s life since she was 15. She hadn’t been at a healthy weight for 33\nyears now, and still couldn’t bear the thought of eating normal meals and not\nvomiting them up. To quiet the illness’s perpetual hissing voice, Heather began\nabusing alcohol, opiates and amphetamines just to get a few minutes of peace and\nquiet in her own head. Her temporary respite had become a crippling addiction.\nShe spent years in institutions and group homes, bouncing from crisis to crisis.\nNothing worked.\n\nFor years, all Jennifer wanted for her only daughter was recovery, or at least\nstabilization – anything better than the living hell in which Heather was\ntrapped. Most of the doctors had long ago thrown up their hands at Heather’s\ncase, claiming they couldn’t help her.\n\n“If you can’t help her live, can you at least help her in death?” Jennifer\nbegged them.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore than 18,400 scientific research articles\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22anorexia+nervosa%22&sort=date] on\nanorexia nervosa are listed in the National Library of Medicine, many of which\nbegin with a similar sentence: anorexia nervosa is the deadliest psychiatric\ndisorder.

It’s a statistic\nthat hasn’t budged in half a century.\n\nYet despite this vast research literature, the doctors treating Heather had no\nguidance on when to allow a patient to stop treatment and if the disorder could,\nin fact, be considered terminal.\n\nA photo of Heather Thompson is displayed at Jennifer Hesketh Aviles’ home office\nin Tucson, Arizona.\n[https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9b669eb524308eb3616ad60284c9e0e3ad7b993/0_0_7735_5157/master/7735.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none]\nA photo of Heather Thompson is displayed at Jennifer Hesketh Aviles’ home office\nin Tucson, Arizona. Photograph: Rebecca Noble/The Guardian\n\nJennifer Gaudiani, one of the country’s few physicians specializing in the\ntreatment of medical complications of eating disorders, couldn’t find anything,\neither, when she cared for a series of three individuals who had decided – with\nGaudiani’s and their family’s agreement – to allow their self-starvation to take\nits ultimate, fatal course.\n\nShe ended up co-authoring an article\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8845309/], published in February\n2022 in the Journal of Eating Disorders, about what she dubbed “terminal\nanorexia nervosa”. It was intended as a guide for physicians like herself, to\nhelp them care for their desperately ill patients. One of those options included\nMaid, which is legal in 10 states and in Washington, DC.\n\nThe article sparked a firestorm in the medical community.\n\n“It was both uncomfortable and painful to receive often pointed condemnation\nfrom colleagues that I respected and from some patients,” she says. “But my\ndiscomfort is far less than the actual discomfort of the people for whom this\narticle was written.”\n\nThe issues Gaudiani raised have an obvious impact for the millions of Americans\nstruggling with anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder. But it goes deeper\nthan just eating disorders. To define terminal anorexia – to decide whether it\nshould be defined at all – requires society to grapple with crucial questions\nabout the nature of refusal of treatment, how an ostensibly treatable illness\ncan be considered terminal, and, most fundamentally, the bodily autonomy of\npsychiatric patients and their capacity to decide when enough is enough.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMillions of years of evolution have given the human body the capacity to\nwithstand prolonged starvation and dehydration. The body can cope, right up\nuntil the moment it can’t. As a result, many with eating disorders can be at\nhigh risk for sudden death even as their blood work appears normal.\n\nThe strain of starvation, binge eating and purging can cause the heart to\nabruptly stop. Some, seeing no escape from a disorder that won’t give them a\nmoment of nutrition, rest or peace, take their own lives. These deaths are\nsudden and often unexpected. Other deaths are slower. As the body runs out of\nenergy to perform even the most basic functions, organs simply shut down. It\noften takes years, even decades, to get to this point of no return.\n\nIt’s something Gaudiani knows all too well. The internist didn’t set out to care\nfor those with eating disorders, but when she learned of an opportunity to head\nup a new, hospital-based unit in Colorado to treat the severe medical\ncomplications of these disorders, she signed up for the challenge. It became her\ncalling.\n\nAs the medical director at the Acute Center in Denver, which specializes in the\ntreatment of severe eating disorders, she watched as the tinctures of nutrition,\nmedication, compassion and time, alongside her patients’ determination, worked\nto help bring them back from the brink of death. Fears of food and weight gain,\nhowever, were deeply ingrained, and many patients tried to bolt.\n\nIn some cases, Gaudiani knew her patients’ illness had taken over their\ndecisions. They had blood sugar readings in the 20s (below 50 can be deadly),\npotassium levels that could stop their hearts at any second, and yet insisted\nthey didn’t need to eat and would be fine. Because these patients were unable to\ngrasp the consequences of their actions, Gaudiani felt they were not competent\nto make decisions about their own health.\n\nportrait\n[https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e51a9f806257e22d43cca09fa32abcd09940b2bf/0_0_2666_4000/master/2666.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none]\nJennifer Gaudiani in Denver. Photograph: Rachel Woolf/The Guardian\n\nOther times, however, patients knew exactly what the outcome of their actions\nwould be. Not long after she began at Acute, Gaudiani began to treat a patient\nwho said she was done with treatment and didn’t want to go back into the\nhospital. The patient knew if she allowed her malnutrition to continue, she\nwould die. But she had tried a variety of programs at hospitals around the\ncountry, and nothing helped. Her primary care physician fired her, saying she\nwas too high-risk, but hospice disagreed that her condition was terminal. After\nseveral long conversations with her patient, Gaudiani agreed that more of the\nsame wouldn’t help.\n\n“We cannot de facto say that because somebody with a starved brain and anorexia\nnervosa is making a choice that some clinicians disagree with that they lack\ncapacity,” she says. “It disrespects the fundamental capacity of some\nindividuals with severe mental illness to make decisions for their own bodies.”\n\nGaudiani searched for guidance from other eating disorder experts and\nbioethicists. She found nothing in the research literature, and no one would\nchime in. Gaudiani was on her own. The young patient wanted to go home and let\nher anorexia run its course. Gaudiani thought she had, at most, days to live.\nWhich was why she was so shocked when her patient called several weeks later,\nstill alive, despite having the weight of an average four-year-old. Her\npatient’s body hung on for another month before finally succumbing to\nmalnutrition.\n\nThe experience haunted Gaudiani throughout her tenure at Acute, and when she\ntransitioned to private practice in 2016.\n\n“I still cannot speak of this story without tearing up. It was a terrible death\nfor her and her parents,” Gaudiani says.\n\nShe vowed she would never let a patient die alone on their couch again. More\nthan a decade later, in 2019, she faced a similar situation with a 34-year-old\nman who had battled anorexia for 18 years. The previous decade of medical\nliterature hadn’t added any guidance for physicians. This time, however,\nGaudiani found a kindred spirit in the New Mexico psychiatrist Joel Yager, who\nestablished the first dedicated eating disorders unit at the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, and had spent 40 years treating adults whose eating\ndisorders did not respond to current treatments. He believed that forcing a\npatient to keep enduring ineffective treatment was tantamount to torture.\nYager’s presence was crucial in helping Gaudiani navigate these stormy waters.\n\nFrom left, Jennifer Gaudiani, MD, looks at EKG results with Abby Brockman, RN.\n[https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef3af0c77befaefd1f88a4a1b1d361e79a4bd029/0_0_4000_2666/master/4000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none]\nGaudiani looks at EKG results with Abby Brockman, RN. Photograph: Rachel\nWoolf/The Guardian\n\nNot long after the young man died, Gaudiani faced the problem again, this time\nwith two patients at the same time. Both lived in states where Maid was legal,\nand Gaudiani said her professional ethics required her to give her patients this\noption. Both agreed, although one died of malnutrition before she took the\nprescribed medication to end her life. The other took the medication and died\npeacefully, surrounded by family.\n\nWhile Gaudiani’s expertise on anorexia was second to none, she knew that most\npeople with eating disorders were being treated by physicians who had only heard\na single lecture on the subject in medical school, if at all. These patients\nneeded help, too. So Gaudiani and Yager decided to write the paper, which would\nsummarize what she had learned about terminal anorexia. One of Gaudiani’s\npatients, Alyssa, was so passionate about the subject that she asked to be a\nposthumous co-author.\n\nIn the paper, Gaudiani, Yager, and Alyssa proposed a set of criteria for\nterminal anorexia: being at least 30 years of age, having engaged in\n“high-quality, multidisciplinary eating disorder care”, and consistently and\nclearly expressing that they understand continued treatment is futile and that\nthey will die from their disorder.\n\nWhen the trio published the paper, Gaudiani braced herself for controversy, but\nnothing prepared her for the intensity of the blowback.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust eat.\n\nThis simple commandment has been the cornerstone of anorexia treatment since the\nEnglish physician Sir William Gull and the French doctor Charles Lasègue first\ndefined anorexia nervosa in western medical literature in 1873. In a world\nburgeoning with multimillion-dollar gene therapies, the idea of serving up three\nsquare meals each day to cure a life-threatening disease seems too good to be\ntrue. And to some extent, it is.\n\nFrom the start, Gull wrote at length about the “willful obstinacy” of the young\nwomen he treated. The only cure was food and rest, to be delivered by those with\n“moral authority” over the person. “The inclination of the patient must be in no\nway consulted,” Gull writes, since left to their own devices, those with\nanorexia could – and sometimes would – starve themselves to death.\n\nEspecially when the illness begins, those with anorexia feel that continuing\nweight loss is exactly what they sought. Far from being a problem, it’s a goal\nto achieve. Even as anorexia tightens its grip, many of those with the condition\ncontinue to assert that nothing is wrong. This, coupled with the deep-seated\nfear of eating and weight gain, means that many with anorexia don’t seek\ntreatment. When they do, they are often ambivalent about recovery, and they can\nbe hostile towards clinicians and the idea of weight gain.\n\nAn exam room in the clinic at Gaudiani Clinic in Denver, Colorado.\n[https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edc55ed27363fe6a61cbc1a996860a7b2482f51c/0_0_4000_2666/master/4000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none]\nAn exam room in at Gaudiani Clinic in Denver, Colorado. Photograph: Rachel\nWoolf/The Guardian\n\nFor decades, doctors tried any range of tonics and tinctures to help, including\nhormone therapy and electroshock. Freud himself posited the disorder resulted\nfrom a fear that eating would result in pregnancy and recommended\npsychoanalysis. Nothing helped. With no effective therapies, blame for\nanorexia’s chronicity fell on the patients, who gained a reputation for being\ndevious and manipulative.\n\nTreatment has changed little in the past 150 years. Especially for the most\nseverely malnourished, the focus remains on refeeding (which can have\npotentially deadly side effects if performed too quickly), and normalizing vital\nsigns and blood chemistry. Other damage caused by the disorder is less obvious\nbut no less concerning. Heart rate and blood pressure drop and digestion slows\nas the body literally eats itself alive for energy. MRI scans of people with\nanorexia\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006322322012902?via%3Dihub]\nreveal a brain that has shrunk dramatically, as a lack of nutrition harms\nneurons and the connections between them. Even relatively short periods of\nstarvation destroy bone mass, leaving 20-year-olds with the brittle bones of an\noctogenarian.\n\nWith the exception of bone density loss, nearly all of these issues are\nreversible with time and renourishment, says Phil Mehler, co-founder and CEO of\nAcute.\n\n“The body isn’t broken. The heart isn’t broken. They’re sick, but they’re not\nirreparably broken. There’s no body system that is,” he says. That’s why he\nremains staunchly opposed to the idea of terminal anorexia and the use of Maid.\n\nKnowledge of the devastation that anorexia inflicts on the body and mind isn’t\nalways enough to spur someone to abandon their disordered behaviors. Cushla\nMcKinney says that, thanks to her PhD in biochemistry, she knew the effects of\nher disorder down to the molecular level. Yet she felt powerless against the\ndemands of anorexia to exercise more and eat less. She was hospitalized numerous\ntimes in her native New Zealand, where even basic creature comforts, such as\nshowers and visits with family, had to be “earned” by gaining weight. McKinney\nate her way out of hospital, only to return to her anorexic ways upon release.\n\n“I had given up on myself,” she says. “It’s incredibly painful to spend your\nentire life starving and exhausted and freezing and stuck in a pattern of\ncompulsive behavior that you just can’t get out of. I just got to a point where\nI didn’t think I could do this any more, that it’s not going to get any better,\nand nothing will make a difference.”\n\nUp to 70% of those hospitalized for anorexia will relapse after discharge,\naccording to some studies [https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12050836].

Photograph: Rebecca Noble/The Guardian\n\nIt’s a hallmark of those with severe forms of the illness, says Angela Guarda,\ndirector of the eating disorders program at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who treated\nMcKinney when she was hospitalized while a postdoctoral fellow at the National\nInstitutes of Health [https://www.theguardian.com/society/health] in Maryland.\nSeveral studies have shown that the higher a care team can nudge a person’s\nweight during intensive treatment, the less likely they are to relapse.\n\nWeight restoration, in and of itself, is only one part of anorexia recovery.\nWhat takes far longer, and is more challenging, is helping those with anorexia\nmaintain their gains, and also address the anxiety, depression, low self-esteem,\ntrauma and crippling perfectionism that often accompany the disorder. “I’ve\ntreated thousands of patients. Not everyone reaches target weight and suddenly\nhas a lightbulb go off. It’s a more gradual process,” Guarda says.\n\nNot surprisingly, the course of illness tends to be protracted. A 1997 study of\nteenagers\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(199712)22:4%3C339::AID-EAT1%3E3.0.CO;2-N]\nhospitalized at UCLA showed it took, on average, seven years for weight, eating\npatterns and body image to fully recover. Some people never make it to that\npoint. An oft-cited 2002 article\n[https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.159.8.1284] created\nwhat’s been nicknamed the rule of thirds: one-third of those with anorexia\nrecover completely, one-third improve and one-third remain chronically ill or\ndie.\n\nJust as importantly, studies have found that the likelihood of recovery hasn’t\nchanged over the past 50 years. The mortality rate of chronic anorexia has been\npegged as high as 20%\n[https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.152.7.1073]. While many\nsuccumb to the physiological effects of starvation, a substantial proportion of\npeople with anorexia take their own lives. Compared with similarly aged peers\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163], women with\nanorexia were 56.9 times more likely to die by suicide, according to another\nstudy.\n\nDespite the grim statistics, Mehler says he has seen “miracles” occur, even in\nthe sickest of the sick who have been life-flighted to Denver with a BMI in the\nsingle digits and entering multi-organ failure.\n\n“A woman will be airlifted to us tomorrow morning at 6am from the east coast.\nI’d say that she has a 98% chance of living,” Mehler says.\n\nBut these miracles require someone to consent to treatment, and not everyone\ndoes.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany mothers weep when they see their daughters in their bridal gowns. Linda\nMazur choked up at Emilee’s beauty, yes, but tears also sprang from her shock\nand horror at just how much weight her 25-year-old daughter had lost in recent\nmonths.\n\n“We were aware that something was off, but she wouldn’t admit what it was,”\nLinda recalls.\n\nOnly months later would she learn that Emilee, then 25, was not only starving\nherself but also abusing laxatives. But she shrugged off her parents’ concerns,\nattributing the weight loss to the stress of the wedding and graduate school.\n\nJack and Linda Mazur hold a photograph of their daughter, Emilee, at home in\nPenfield, New York.\n[https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8264671aee9e8bec19000d3422dcb2465096dd45/0_0_4810_7211/master/4810.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none]\nJack and Linda Mazur hold a photograph of their daughter, Emilee, at home in\nPenfield, New York. Photograph: Lauren Petracca/The Guardian\n\nLinda held her breath and waited for her daughter to reverse the downward trend.\nIf anything, it accelerated, despite Emilee’s regular visits with her physician\nand therapist.\n\nPowerless to do anything besides encourage their daughter to seek more help,\nLinda and her husband, Jack, watched as anorexia deepened its hold on Emilee.\n\nAfter several years and the dissolution of her marriage, Emilee agreed to seek\nspecialized treatment and took a medical leave from work. But when she gained\ntwo pounds in six days, her insurance kicked her out. Emilee now weighed more\nthan 75% of her ideal body weight, which meant insurance deemed hospital-based\ncare no longer medically necessary.\n\nIt confirmed what the eating disorder was whispering to Emilee: that she was too\nfat for treatment, and didn’t deserve help. She returned home to Rochester, New\nYork, where she vowed never to be humiliated in such a way again. It didn’t take\nlong for her to return to laxative abuse. Emilee threw herself into her job, but\nher eating disorder only got worse and eventually she had to stop working.\nDistraught and unemployed, she began to drink.\n\nEven if Emilee had agreed to return to treatment, Linda says she didn’t know if\nany treatment centers would take her. Eating disorder facilities told Linda they\ncouldn’t treat her because of her severe alcohol abuse. Drug rehabs refused her\ndue to her eating disorder. She was too medically compromised for a psychiatric\nunit, but her anorexia symptoms were too challenging for a general medical ward.\nAnd while Rochester had hospital-based eating disorder programs for teens, they\ndidn’t treat adults like Emilee.\n\nMan points to photo in cabinet with framed photos and figurines while woman\nlooks on\n[https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d21895937fcc9524b832694a26b12409444ec03f/0_0_7919_5282/master/7919.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none]\nJack and Linda Mazur with a memorial for Emilee. Photograph: Lauren Petracca/The\nGuardian\n\nBattered by starvation and booze, Emilee became a frequent flyer at the local\nemergency department. She would stay long enough to receive IV fluids and other\ntreatments to keep her from dying immediately, just to return home and begin the\ncycle anew.\n\nTerrified of Emilee’s downward trajectory, Linda and Jack asked whether their\ndaughter might be treated involuntarily. This would require a psychiatrist and\njudge to declare that she lacked the mental capacity to refuse care. Since\nEmilee appeared outwardly rational and seemed to comprehend the consequences of\nher decision, however, psychiatrists repeatedly ruled her competent to refuse\ntreatment, despite her life-threateningly low body weight and alcoholism. So\nEmilee discharged herself and the cycle continued.\n\n“It should have never got to that point, because she wasn’t competent to make\nall those decisions,” Linda says.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStephen Touyz, a psychiatrist at the University of Sydney who has treated\nanorexia patients for 30 years, had seen plenty of patients like Emilee.\nAvailable treatments fell short, and all Touyz could offer was more of the same.\n\n“We have nothing else to give but the same treatment that’s failed. That’s\nunacceptable to me,” Touyz said.\n\nHe believed that Emilee and people like her – with what he called severe and\nenduring anorexia nervosa – needed and deserved something better. But how do you\ntest the efficacy of a treatment for those who are disillusioned with medicine\nand drop out of trials at alarmingly high rates?\n\nTouyz did it by not requiring any weight gain. The goal of his therapy was to\nimprove quality of life. Patients had to commit to not losing more weight, and\nthough he said he would move heaven and earth to help them gain it if they\nwished, that was not the goal. He took out full-page advertisements in local\nnewspapers in Sydney and London, and waited.\n\nrock says “thank you for giving me the privilege of being your father - dad”\n[https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea4b4f0d9116fe8b00c692aecfb1885f4580cd2/0_0_7758_5175/master/7758.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none]\nJack Mazur holds a rock with a message he wrote during his daughter’s calling\nhours. Photograph: Lauren Petracca/The Guardian\n\nAlmost immediately, the phone began to ring. It didn’t take Touyz long to\nrecruit 63 people for his trial, in Sydney, Melbourne and London. His study,\npublished in 2013, compared cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; often used to\ntreat anorexia, but Touyz removed the parts of the treatment that pushed weight\ngain) with general supportive care.\n\nIn both treatment arms [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23642330/], Touyz found,\nhis patients’ quality of life improved significantly, even in the absence of\nweight gain. Two patients improved to the point where they were able to become\npregnant and start families. To eating disorder professionals, who had long\nsince thrown up their hands in despair, Touyz proved that it was possible to\ntreat those with long-term anorexia. A 2017 study\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883487/] that followed people\ndiagnosed with anorexia and bulimia for an average of 22 years supports Touyz’s\napproach. The work there found that only one-third of those with anorexia\nrecovered after 10 years, but that rate doubled after another decade.\n\n“Never lose hope,” he says. “Some patients are ill for 10, 15, 20 years and they\nstill recover.”\n\nBut even Touyz himself admits that, for his approach to work, patients need to\nfind some sort of balance between a weight that is at least minimally tolerable\nand the life they want to live.\n\nNot everyone, however, can find this kind of balance. Their illness is just too\nsevere, too relentless to carve out even a fragile detente. For them, Touyz\nsays, hospice care may be the only option that can alleviate their suffering.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen Heather first got sick at 15, Jennifer believed her daughter’s stubbornness\nwould eventually evict anorexia and bulimia from her life. Instead, it was\nHeather’s stubbornness – reflected in her fiery green eyes and jaw-length hair\ndyed raven black – that kept her disorders fully entrenched.\n\nAs the decades passed and her daughter’s illness intensified, Jennifer began to\nshift her hopes away from full recovery to just keeping her daughter alive. The\nyears of profound malnutrition coupled with addiction, however, soon made\nstaying alive all but impossible. The irony, Jennifer says, is that for all the\ntimes Heather was threatened with hospice, she couldn’t actually find a hospice\nteam when death began to seem almost inevitable in 2019. Doctors only offered\nmore of the same treatments that had failed before.\n\ngirl with soccer ball\n[https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/606c616e3d738922672523830d331c53f84370ed/0_0_647_932/master/647.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none]\nHeather Thompson as a child. Photograph: Courtesy of Jennifer Hesketh Aviles\n\nInstead, the emergency room became Heather’s second home. The doctors and nurses\nknew Heather by sight and had little compassion for her. “They figured, why are\nwe wasting resources on this woman when there are other people who are willing\nto fight?” Jennifer said.\n\nAs the Delta variant of Covid-19 began its global surge, Heather began to\ndevelop bedsores. To Heather, these provided a pathway to death for her\nweakened, wasted body that continued to survive a ruthless eating disorder and\naddiction. She hid them from nurses and refused antibiotics when they invariably\nbecame infected. Finally, weakened and septic, Heather relented and called 911,\nand she was rushed to the hospital. Physicians cut away the dead, infected\ntissue to allow the wounds to heal, which only worsened Heather’s pain.\n\n“Morphine! Give me morphine!” Her shrieks of agony echoed through the hospital’s\nsterile halls. They were some of the last words Jennifer heard her daughter\nspeak.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Heather developed pneumonia and was admitted to the\nICU for a ventilator. The ICU team gathered Jennifer, Heather’s stepfather, and\nher father for a conference. If Heather’s heart stopped, CPR would cause\ncatastrophic damage to her ribcage. Her prognosis was grim, and her doctor\nrecommended comfort care. Everyone agreed to remove life support, and on 2\nOctober 2021, Heather took her last breath.\n\nThe next day, Jennifer posted the following message on Facebook: “So, yes, do\nsay her name. Heather Thompson. Our beloved daughter passed away peacefully\nearly yesterday evening after an unbelievably difficult two weeks during which\nshe fought a serious infection and pneumonia and more than 30 years an\nentrenched eating disorder and co-occurring illnesses. She is in such a better\nplace now with God and among the Angels.”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen Gaudiani and Yager’s paper on terminal anorexia was published in February\n2022, Jennifer’s grief remained fresh and raw. Reading the article, however,\nprovided a balm. Maybe if more doctors understood the grim reality of what it\nmeant to die from anorexia, fewer mothers would have to watch their daughter’s\nagonizing death throes, Jennifer says.\n\nBut the quiet support of Jennifer and other parents who had lost their children\nto anorexia and bulimia was drowned out by more vocal objections. Within days of\nthe paper publishing, the conservative columnist Wesley Smith wrote in the\nNational Review\n[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/pushing-assisted-suicide-for-terminal-anorexia/]\nthat “allowing assisted suicide for psychiatric illnesses would open the door\nwide for medicalized killing”.\n\nGuarda, of Johns Hopkins, and Mehler, of the Acute Center\n[http://www.acute.org/], had more specific concerns, arguing that terminal\nanorexia\n[https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-022-00599-6] was a\n“dangerous term that cannot, and should not, be defined”. Both had seen patients\nreturn from the brink of death and build meaningful, happy lives. Guarda also\nsays that she is unable to predict exactly which patients will do well, and who\nwill remain severely ill. Her fear is a patient with the potential for recovery\ngetting labeled as terminal.\n\nportrait of woman sitting outside\n[https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9fb56c29ecbdcbf27237f42fec2b63a4f860235/499_0_4889_3592/master/4889.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none]\nJennifer Hesketh Aviles, mother of Heather Thompson, at home. Photograph:\nRebecca Noble/The Guardian\n\nMore than that, she worries that patients will label themselves as terminal and\ngive up all hope – something she witnessed not long after Gaudiani’s paper was\npublished.\n\n“When they’re in the depths of the illness, often patients cannot imagine that\nthey can live without their anorexia,” Guarda says. “In most cases, I just\nassume people have the capacity to get better because I’ve been proved wrong too\nmany times.”\n\nMcKinney echoes that fear. After months of treatment at Johns Hopkins, she has\nreturned to New Zealand, where she works as a PhD scientist and lives with her\nhusband and children – things she never felt were possible when in the throes of\nanorexia. “By that stage, I was so tired and so hopeless, that I think I would\nhave chosen [hospice],” she says. When asked if she was glad that hospice hadn’t\nbeen an option, she doesn’t hesitate to answer yes.\n\nTo Mehler and his colleague Patricia Westmoreland, a forensic psychiatrist who\nworks with Mehler to assess anorexia patients for capacity to refuse treatment,\na major issue is how starvation impacts the brain. He cites the brain shrinkage\nstudies and points out how resistance to treatment and weight gain are defining\ncharacteristics of anorexia. Calling the illness “terminal”, even in just a few\npatients, risks colluding with their eating disorder. “It’s going to have a\ncontagion effect. Everybody’s going to give up and say ‘I have terminal\nanorexia, just put me in hospice,’” Mehler says.\n\nGaudiani disagrees entirely.\n\n“Anybody with an eating disorder remembers the hopelessness, the many days where\nthey thought they just don’t want to be alive,” Gaudiani says. “There is a\ndifference between hopelessness, wishing that you didn’t have to deal with life\nany more, wishing you were dead, and making the choice, ‘I’m entering hospice. I\nam progressing towards my death without anything interfering.’ There is a major\ndifference between those.”\n\nStill, the differences between how Guarda, Mehler and Gaudiani would treat\nsomeone with a severe, decades-long eating disorder who has been consistently\nfailed by existing treatments aren’t as different as their positions would\nsuggest. All three have, on occasion, referred patients to hospice and have\nbegun turning to so-called harm reduction approaches, which focus on reducing\nbehaviors rather than eliminating them entirely, especially for those who cannot\nrecover fully, even after trying for decades.\n\nThe difference between them is Gaudiani’s creation and use of a category called\nterminal anorexia, and her openness to Maid. However, she remains steadfast that\nshe wants to help her patients. “This is not giving up on patients. This is not\ngiving up on patients who suffer for a long time. This is not thinking that\nrecovery isn’t potentially possible. It’s none of those things,” Gaudiani says.\nAcknowledging that some patients don’t survive their illness and might need the\nsupport of Maid or hospice doesn’t detract from someone’s capacity to fully\nrecover from their disorder, she argues.\n\nDespite Guarda’s and Mehler’s arguments to the contrary, Jennifer and the Mazurs\nsay that a discussion about terminal anorexia is exactly what the field needs.\nAfter witnessing Emilee’s steady, inexorable deterioration even after her\ntreatment at Acute, her parents, too, tried to help Emilee find palliative care.\nThey thought that if they took the emphasis off weight loss, Emilee could focus\non quality of life. Like Heather, the Mazurs were rebuffed.\n\nThey had run out of treatment options for Emilee. During another admission at a\ndifferent hospital, they found a palliative care physician who diagnosed Emilee\nwith “terminal recalcitrant anorexia nervosa”, and agreed to treat her in\nhospice. Jack Mazur wept at the diagnosis – not just out of grief, but out of\nrelief that someone was taking his daughter’s anorexia seriously.\n\n“Nobody wanted to deal with it,” he says.\n\nEmilee’s last days were spent in a dedicated hospice home, where she breathed\nher last breath with her loving parents looking on. The family says they take a\nsmall comfort in knowing they did everything they could for Emilee, and that she\ndidn’t take her own life or die alone.\n\nWhen asked about the physicians who said terminal anorexia wasn’t a real\ndiagnosis, Jack’s voice shook with uncharacteristic rage. “For people to read\nthat article by Dr Gaudiani and call her Dr Death is just … I was so angry when\nI saw that,” Jack says.\n\nGaudiani isn’t surprised that families who have experienced the agony of\nwatching their child die support the idea of terminal anorexia. These cases, she\nsays, are thankfully rare, but these individuals are no less deserving of the\ncompassion and care given to those on the path to recovery.\n\n“Even as I respect people’s rights to dissent, I’m also not going to back down,”\nshe says. “I know for a fact that this advocacy is correct and that these\nindividuals deserve to be cared for compassionately at the end of their lives.”\n\n * This article was amended on 13 July 2023 after the Mazur family provided some\n   additional details about their story."

        "content": "Labeled as the next “superfood\n[https://www.osfhealthcare.org/blog/bee-pollen/],” bee pollen is a dietary\nsupplement known for its vitamins and anti-inflammatory elements. Originally\nused for allergy prevention, people are now using bee pollen in hopes of\nadjusting their hormone levels and, as a result, potentially increasing breast\nsize.\n\nThe use of the supplement as a way to treat hormone issues is all over social\nmedia. TikToker Taylor Reynolds made a video in which she asked hormone doctors\nto explain the phenomenon after it caused breast growth for her, her sister and\nher roommate. The video reached 2.5 million views\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@imtaylorreynolds/video/7248670459191921962?_r=1&_t=8dsRc0p3P2o].\n\nIn another viral video\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@iveycross/video/7249793798165810474?_r=1&_t=8dsRYhuxWDz],\nTikToker Ivey Cross discussed the use of bee pollen in her drinks, which she\nclaims contributed to breast growth.\n\n“It dawned on me that I have been using this consistently for like, two or three\nweeks, and two nights ago, I went to put on my Skims bra, and I always keep it\nat the same adjustment, and I was like, ‘oh, my gosh, this is kind of tight.’\nSo, I had to loosen it up a little bit.”\n\nAlthough there are no large clinical studies that support the use of bee pollen\nfor breast growth, a diet containing phytoestrogens ― a compound derived from\nplants that can be found in bee pollen ― can mimic estrogen.\n\nSince bee pollen is rich in phytoestrogen, taking the supplement may weakly bind\nto estrogen receptors and potentially suppress production, Lisa Jung, a licensed\nnaturopathic doctor at Jung Naturopathic Wellness\n[https://jungnaturopathicwellness.com/] in California, told HuffPost. In theory,\na suppression of estrogen could lead to physical changes.\n\n“One example of the body areas that have these estrogen receptors are the breast\ntissues, and that may be why some women have been noticing their breast growth\nwith bee pollen consumption,” Jung said.\n\nThat said, this isn’t a guarantee ― nor is it the only thing at play when it\ncomes to breast size.\n\n“Breast size and development is dependent on multiple factors, including\ngenetics, hormones and fat distribution,” Dr. Sydne Ford, a board-certified\nfamily medicine physician at Spark Performance and Wellness\n[https://www.sparkwellnessga.com/], a holistic primary care center, told\nHuffPost. “There are no guaranteed methods for increasing breast size naturally.\nHowever, exercise and a balanced diet rich in phytoestrogens can help maintain\noptimal hormone levels.”\n\nA small 1990 study by the Monash University Department of Medicine\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1664107/] at Prince Henry’s\nHospital in Australia also found that phytoestrogens may mitigate perimenopausal\nsymptoms\n[https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/pollen-extract].\nJung said the phytoestrogen in bee pollen may also be “beneficial for PMS,\nhormonal migraines and acne, excess estrogen in the body and menopausal symptoms\nlike hot flashes.”\n\nAccording to a 2010 study by the Department of Biology at North Carolina State\nUniversity in Raleigh, other uses of phytoestrogens include the prevention of\nosteoporosis [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074428/], or\nprogressive loss of bone-mineral density, and a reduced risk of cardiovascular\ndisease.\n\n“There are mixed human and animal studies that show bee pollen can also be\nbeneficial for liver, prostate conditions as well as metabolic conditions like\nhigh cholesterol, diabetes, obesity\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074428/] and more,” Jung said.\n\nBee pollen has also been used as a form of allergy treatment.\n[https://www.healthline.com/health/allergies/bee-pollen-for-allergies] “Some\npeople report a reduction of environmental allergy symptoms when consuming bee\npollen. However, there is limited scientific evidence to support these claims,”\nFord said.\n\n\n\n\nRISKS OF USING BEE POLLEN AS A SUPPLEMENT\n\n\n\nLike any supplement, there are potential risks to using bee pollen, Ford said.\nIt has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use.\n\nBee pollen can cause new allergic reactions\n[https://www.lancastergeneralhealth.org/healthwise-library/healthwise-article?documentId=d04469a1],\nincluding hives, light-headedness, difficulty breathing, and swelling of the\nface, lips, tongue or throat. For people who are taking the supplement in hopes\nof breast growth, side effects may also occur as a result of increased estrogen.\n\n“With breast tissue growth, there can be concerns of cancer, as too much tissue\ngrowth can lead to atypical cellular changes,” Jung said. “For some women, they\ncan experience mild vaginal spotting or bleeding, as the uterine lining also has\nestrogen receptors that can be stimulated.”\n\nAdditionally, digestive side effects, such as stomach pain, nausea or diarrhea,\nand interactions with medications are all risks associated with taking natural\nproducts like bee pollen. It’s especially important to not take bee pollen\nsupplements if you have a bee pollen allergy\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3394823/].\n\nGenerally, it’s not certain if bee pollen is effective in treating medical\nconditions like menopause or hormone issues. As a result, you should ask a\ndoctor if bee pollen is safe for you, especially if taking any additional\nmedications and supplements.\n\n“It’s important to work with a provider who can guide in the benefits and risks\nof natural foods and supplements, even if they are natural,” Jung said. “It’s\nalso important to work with a provider who can counsel on the importance of\nchecking breast tissue or getting diagnostic imaging like mammograms or\nultrasound as well.”"

Our solar\nsystem's star drives weather on Earth, influences ocean currents, climate\n[https://www.salon.com/topic/climate_change] and makes plant life possible. But\nonly relatively recently have humans developed mechanisms to protect ourselves\nfrom it as much as physically possible when exposed. Of course we're talking\nabout sunscreen. While there is evidence that Ancient Egyptians and Greeks\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8682817/] used mixtures of plant\nextracts to prevent tanning (they likely didn't know about the harmful effects\nof ultraviolet radiation from the Sun), the first sunblock was developed less\nthan a century ago.\n\nToday, there are many to choose from and the importance of its use is emphasized\nin the mere fact that rates of melanoma have been rising rapidly over the past\nfew decades.\n\nHowever, sunscreen has a PR problem. One in which headlines often point out that\nsome sunscreens have previously included carcinogenic or potentially\ncarcinogenic chemicals. Indeed, in July 2021, Johnson & Johnson recalled five\naerosol sunscreen products\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/15/johnson-and-johnson-sunscreen-recall-benzene]\nbecause they had been contaminated with benzene, a known carcinogen. The\npresence of the chemical wasn't intentional.\n\n\"The people who get skin cancer, they virtually all say 'I wish I protected\nmyself from the sun years ago.'\"\n\nIn 2019, the FDA requested additional safety data\n[https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-advances-new-proposed-regulation-make-sure-sunscreens-are-safe-and-effective]\non sunscreen components from manufacturers, heightening fears around safety and\nsunscreen. Consumer watchdogs like the Environmental Working Group\n[https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/] often publish warnings about the potential\nhealth risks of sunscreen chemicals. And it's not just the potential to harm\nhuman health, but also the environment. In 2018, Hawaii banned sunscreens\n[https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/03/health/hawaii-sunscreen-ban/index.html] that\ncontain octinoxate and oxybenzone fearing that they could damage coral reefs.\nConcerns have also been raised about the use oxybenzone, a potential hormone\ndisruptor\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/1105240], in\nsunscreen.\n\nThe seeming catch-22 of sunscreen has made it difficult for some people to\nchoose the right sunscreen — or wear it at all. However, in the United States,\nskin cancer is the most common type of cancer. It's estimated that one-fifth of\nAmericans will develop some form of it in their lifetimes — a striking statistic\nto dermatologists given it's also one of the most preventable cancers. While\nmost cancers are caused by genetic mutations in DNA that trigger genes in normal\ncell growth to become oncogenes, skin cancer is caused by excessive sun\nexposure. And most Americans don't wear sunscreen regularly\n[https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2015/no-sunscreen].\n\n\"There are more skin cancers than all other cancers combined in the United\nStates,\" Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, a clinical professor of dermatology at Mount\nSinai Icahn School of Medicine and former president of the American Academy of\nDermatology, told Salon. \"Melanoma, the most dangerous kind of skin cancer, is\nthe most common cancer in women ages 25 to 29 and the second most common after\nbreast cancer in women ages 30 to 34. It strikes younger, and we are seeing\nyounger and younger people get it.\"\n\nRigel said when weighing the risk of chemicals in sunscreen and getting skin\ncancer, what is really happening is that people are weighing an \"unproven risk\nwith a proven benefit.\"\n\n\"It's an unproven hypothetical risk that has actually been disproven in some\nstudies, versus a proven risk,\" Rigel said. \"But I'm biased because I see all\nthe people who get skin cancer, but the people who get skin cancer, they\nvirtually all say 'I wish I protected myself from the sun years ago.'\"\n\n\"It's an unproven hypothetical risk versus a proven risk.\"\n\nThe sun gives off two kinds of damaging rays: UVA light, which causes wrinkles\nand UVB, which causes sunburn. Both contribute to the development of skin\ncancer. (There are also UVC rays, which are far more dangerous than UVA or UVB,\nbut they luckily don't reach the Earth's surface\n[https://www.cancercenter.com/cancer-types/skin-cancer/risk-factors/uv-rays].)\nSunscreen works by blocking UV light via physical or chemical filters or both.\nSunscreens that contain titanium dioxide and zinc oxide create a physical\nbarrier between the skin and the Sun. These sunscreens physically reflect light\noff the skin. Then there are chemical sunscreens that are designed to absorb UV\nrays, acting as sponges that turn damaging rays harmless.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox?

Brod, a clinical\nprofessor of dermatology at University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of\nMedicine, told Salon. \"But we don't have any evidence to show that chemical\nsunscreens that are absorbed in the skin are harmful.\"\n\nIndeed, two separate FDA studies published in 2019\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2733085] and 2020\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2759002] found that\ningredients commonly found in chemical sunscreens, including oxybenzone, can be\nabsorbed in the skin and linger for days. However, what Brod and other\ndermatologists are quick to point out is that there is no evidence to suggest\nthat it's harmful and causes cancer. In both studies, the authors emphasized\nthat their findings did not mean people should refrain from wearing sunscreen.\n\n\"We don't have any evidence to show that chemical sunscreens that are absorbed\nin the skin are harmful.\"\n\n\"The benzene issue was a one-off. There were some impurities in the production\nprocess, but it's been fixed,\" Rigel said, adding that a separate study found\nthat exposure to benzene in a sunscreen — assuming you used it everyday for a\nyear — was still less than the amount of benzene inhaled when filling up a tank\nat the gas station.\n\nThe tide is turning on research suggesting that sunscreen poses environmental\nrisks, too. Aaron Boyd, a PhD candidate at the University of Alberta in\nEdmonton, Canada, recently demonstrated how exposure to sunscreen may actually\nbe a lower risk for small aquatic animals compared to some tests done on each\nindividual chemical.\n\n\"Researchers overwhelmingly perform studies testing the toxicity of UVFs\n[ultraviolet filters] in isolation by exposing test organisms to one chemical at\na time,\" Boyd said in a media statement\n[https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/994067], describing an experiment on\nwater fleas. \"In fact, less than 3% of aquatic toxicology studies published to\ndate have investigated whole sunscreen mixtures, leaving a massive knowledge gap\nto be addressed.\"\n\nWhen it comes to sunscreen, the FDA isn't responsible for safety testing.\nInstead, it sets the standards that companies have a responsibility to follow.\nHowever, the FDA has proposed experiments to be done to better understand the\neffects of sunscreen.\n\n\"But those experiments are basically done every weekend in the summer when tens\nof millions of people are using sunscreen. And they're not seeing any of those\nhypothetical risks,\" Rigel said. \"So the bottom line with that, is it's not a\nmajor risk to wear sunscreen. The flip side is what's the risk of not using\nsunscreen, right? That is a proven risk and the risk is skin cancer.\""

        "content": "The first Adderall ad appeared in my Instagram feed during the height of\npandemic isolation. I thought the slick 30-second video promising me a \"super\neasy\" way to get ADHD medication was another gimmick. But after the algorithm\npushed a few more plugs my way, I started to get curious. The drugs, to my\nsurprise, were real. Unlike countless sketchy ads for black-market supplements,\nCerebral\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/cerebral-cuts-15-percent-staff-285-employees-layoffs-february-2023-2],\nthe then-hot telehealth startup behind the ads, offered a legal path to\nprescription medications.\n\nIt was indeed a \"super easy\" path — too easy. My intake process to get\nprescribed a potentially addictive amphetamine turned out to be easier than\ngetting Taylor Swift tickets or an appointment with my primary-care physician.\nEven as I doubted that I met the clinical criteria for ADHD, I could honestly\nanswer the vague, brief self-assessment (e.g., \"How often do you have difficulty\npaying attention when you are doing boring or repetitive work?\") and receive the\nsame result as tens of thousands of AI-targeted customers: \"You have some\nsymptoms consistent with ADHD. We suggest further evaluation.\" When I spoke to a\nCerebral nurse practitioner for all of 13 minutes, the experience was much the\nsame. Answering that, yes, my concentration was strained in the middle of a\nonce-in-a-century pandemic got me an official diagnosis and prescription. Like\nits many telehealth competitors, including Done [https://www.donefirst.com/],\nKlarity [https://www.klarityadhd.com/], adhdonline.com [http://adhdonline.com/],\nand Circle Medical, [https://www.circlemedical.com/]Cerebral could peddle,\nprescribe, and postmark a package of Adderall for me while I never left the\ncouch. \n\nA new breed of direct-to-consumer services is aggressively using targeted ads to\nsell habit-forming medications. Not only do these companies make it easier for\nthose seeking recreational drugs to access them, they're also poised to inundate\nand threaten the sobriety of people in recovery. And unlike a typical prescriber\nwho might interrogate answers to assess genuine need, some of these firms appear\nto be designed to remove every possible barrier.\n\nIn short, AI and surveillance capitalism, which empower today's targeted ads,\nhave joined forces with the deadly OxyContin playbook. But unlike the opioid\ncrisis of the early 2000s, advertisers today have much more data and far more\nprecise tools to push prescriptions, and our privacy laws haven't even tried to\nkeep up. Without intervention, another public-health catastrophe looms.\n\n\n'THROWING ANTIPSYCHOTICS AROUND LIKE CANDY'\n\nAn algorithm can't create addiction out of nothing, but it can be the crucial\nconnector that lets companies reach those most at risk. Looking back on my\nCerebral experience now, the similarities to the opioid crisis are clear. Having\nresearched the rise of Purdue Pharma's OxyContin blight, the most pernicious\ncatalyst was the same thing I saw in those Instagram ads: aggressive,\ndata-driven marketing. As Dr. Art Van Zee wrote in the American Journal of\nPublic Health [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622774/#bib4] in\n2009, \"One of the cornerstones of Purdue's marketing plan was the use of\nsophisticated marketing data to influence physicians' prescribing.\" The Sackler\nfamily's pharma giant, he wrote, used \"prescriber profiles on individual\nphysicians — detailing the prescribing patterns of physicians nationwide — in an\neffort to influence doctors' prescribing habits.\"\n\nOxyContin was pharmacologically unremarkable, analogous to countless opioid\nmedications that had been on the market for decades.\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14585554/] But Purdue discovered an ingenious,\nand calamitous, edge: harnessing data to target doctors with an onslaught of\nmarketing materials, cajoling prescribers to hand out the medication more\nfreely, and making the disastrous promise that their formulation was less\naddictive. It wasn't. OxyContin was patented in 1996, and Purdue's blitzkrieg\nmarketing campaign began soon after, largely triggering the opioid epidemic.\nBetween 1999 and 2017, drug overdose deaths involving prescription opioids\nclimbed from some 3,000 a year to more than 17,000 a year\n[https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#:~:text=Drug%20overdose%20deaths%20involving%20prescription,involving%20prescription%20opioids%20totaled%2016%2C706.].\nBy 2017, Purdue's annual revenue had grown to $35 billion.\n\nNow bankrupt, Purdue stands as a warning for any pharmaceutical company that\nwould try to recruit physicians with the same predatory tactics — yet they\npersist. Just as important, it's hard to believe that any doctor today would\ntrust a pharmaceutical rep peddling pain meds with a similar claim. But online\nprescribers don't need to market to the doctor, because they are the doctor, and\npatients are left with no one but themselves to look out for their well-being.\n\n> Online prescribers don't need to market to the doctor, because they are the\n> doctor, and patients are left with no one but themselves to look out for their\n> well-being.\n\nPhysicians have already begun to warn that the Adderall crisis could repeat\nhistory. \"The prescription amphetamine crisis is growing and could catch up to\nthe opioid epidemic in scope and damage,\" Dr. David Sack wrote in \"Psychology\nToday\" in 2018.\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/where-science-meets-the-steps/201805/will-adderall-be-the-new-opioid-crisis]\nThe Canadian psychiatrist Anthony Yeung has studied\n[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/07067437221082854] misinformation\nin videos about ADHD on TikTok and found that deception is rampant. \"Without a\ndoubt targeted ads (especially peak pandemic) have had an outsized impact\" on\nAdderall prescription rates, he told me, though he noted researchers still\nstruggle to access ad data on many platforms, so it can be hard to map out the\nprecise effect. And while Adderall is what most fueled these telehealth firms'\ngrowth over the past three years, they also market a number of highly addictive\nmedications. They are just as much a ticking time bomb for those addicted to\nsedatives like Xanax and other habit-forming medications.\n\nWith AI-augmented advertising, finding yourself targeted only takes a single\nmoment of engagement. After I first visited the Cerebral site, I was soon faced\nwith dozens of ads. Some days it felt like they were a majority of the ads I saw\non multiple social-media platforms. For me, the pattern was suspicious, but for\nsomeone struggling with addiction, it feels diabolical. These ads may overwhelm\nthose in recovery — imagine trying to fight dependency and protect your health\nwhile these firms constantly bombard you with temptation. (On the flip side, the\ngrowing use of Adderall recreationally makes the medication far more difficult\nto find for those who actually have ADHD. In 2022, telehealth prescriptions\naccounted for 40% of all Adderall prescriptions\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/14/adderall-shortage-telehealth-prescriptions/],\ndriving record usage.)\n\nThis is the nature of online advertising. This is why you see the same pair of\nshoes following you online from website to website, or why the trip you almost\nbooked is constantly in your feed. Advertisers systematically target those who\nare on the verge of buying. A dollar spent on those who've shown interest is\nseen as far more valuable than a dollar spent on someone who may be a terrible\nfit for the product. But these companies have no way of knowing who's addicted\nor in recovery. Last year, a nurse practitioner warned Cerebral' s approach is\n\"risky because you really have to figure out who is drug seeking and who is\nreally suffering from ADHD.\"\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/cerebral-adderall-adhd-prescribe-11654705250] Yann\nPoncin, a clinical child psychiatrist at the Yale School of Medicine, told me\nthat \"when it gets to that level of targeted marketing, there's no way for\npeople to know what other people are experiencing.\" We as a society may have\ncome to accept being stalked by targeted ads, but the consequences are much\ngraver when the product itself is a danger. Getting hounded by that chew toy you\nthought of buying your shih tzu is one thing; getting harassed by a drug that\nmirrors methamphetamine is an entirely different matter. \n\nAnd the scale is stunning. Last year, The Wall Street Journal\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/cerebral-adderall-adhd-prescribe-11654705250]\ndetailed how at one point, Cerebral's ad buy had become so immense it was the\nthird-largest advertiser on TikTok. And as the company grew, employees became\nalarmed. Some worried that the platform could enable addiction. One nurse\npractitioner told Insider that employees \"will just throw antipsychotics around\nlike it's fucking candy.\"\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/telehealth-startup-cerebral-prescribed-psych-meds-2022-6]\nCerebral said\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/14/adderall-shortage-telehealth-prescriptions/]\nlast year that its \"clinicians exercise their independent professional judgment\nin diagnosing and treating their patients,\" but that same Journal article\nreported that company leaders had urged employees to prescribe ADHD to 100% of\npatients without comorbidities. The company was far from alone in flooding the\nzone. In just four weeks last year, 20 telehealth companies ran more than 2,100\nads\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/telehealth-cerebral-done-ads-mental-health-adhd-11672161087]\npromoting unapproved uses of prescription meds or failing to list their risks.\nAs Bloomberg reported\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-03-11/cerebral-app-over-prescribed-adhd-meds-ex-employees-say?sref=XIzXWjPY],\nthe approach could accelerate the crises of people already dealing with complex\nmental-health issues.\n\n\nBAN TARGETED ADS\n\nConsequences for its hyperaggressive tactics have caught up with Cerebral. As\nthe Journal reported, after ADHD medications grew to 20% of the VC-funded\ncompany's business, driving a $4.8 billion valuation, things came crashing to\nearth. Cerebral's CEO was fired, many employees left, subpoenas from federal\nprosecutors were served, and a growing number of pharmacy partners stopped\nfilling the company's prescriptions, prompting the company to stop offering ADHD\ndrugs.\n\nBut Cerebral's collapse is far from the end of this saga. The relaxed\nregulations that emerged during the COVID pandemic are a big part of the\nproblem. Early in the pandemic, the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Department\nof Health and Human Services suspended the Ryan Haight Act, a 2008 law that\nrequired telehealth providers to have at least one in-person session with a\nclient before writing prescriptions for Schedule 2 medications, which includes\nhabit-forming medications like Adderall, OxyContin, and Xanax\n[https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/#:~:text=Examples%20of%20Schedule%20II%20narcotics,opium%2C%20codeine%2C%20and%20hydrocodone.].\nThe move made sense then but removed the guardrails to protect against the exact\nsort of abuses that led to the death of the Ryan Haight Act's namesake, a\nCalifornia teenager who overdosed on Vicodin that he was prescribed online.\n\n> We as a society may have come to accept being stalked by targeted ads, but\n> consequences are much graver when the product itself is a danger.\n\nEven after the official end of the COVID-19 public-health emergency, companies\nare still able to prescribe Schedule 2 substances without an in-person visit.\nThe suspension of the Ryan Haight Act\n[https://telehealth.hhs.gov/providers/telehealth-policy/prescribing-controlled-substances-via-telehealth]\nis currently set to expire on November 11, 2023, but there's no guarantee that\nthe rollback won't be delayed. \n\nIn the interim, numerous competitors are jumping into the breach. In the course\nof researching this piece, I was served ads for ADHD medications from the rival\ntelehealth startup Done [https://www.donefirst.com/], and friends sent me\nexamples of targeted ads on Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter from firms offering\neverything from ADHD-care apps to Adderall and even psychedelics like ketamine.\n\nSadly, the solution isn't as simple as rolling back the regulations that allow\ncompanies to prescribe these drugs. Not only is telemedicine more convenient, it\nalso offers a lifeline to millions of individuals without local access to care\nor who find it too expensive. Instead, we need a middle ground. Rather than\nrestricting prescribers' ability to give medications remotely, we can focus on\nthe promotional and sales tactics that set these firms apart from a family\ndoctor who sees a patient over a video call. We can improve intake and\nassessment requirements. We can have automatic audits for firms with abnormally\nhigh levels of Schedule 2 prescriptions.\n\nThe same proposal Art Van Zee made to quell the OxyContin scourge in 2009 would\nstand today: \"The public health would be better protected if the FDA reviewed\nall advertising ... for their truthfulness, accuracy, balance, and scientific\nvalidity, before dissemination.\"\n\nBut above all, we need rules that ban targeted ads for drugs that can get\npatients hooked. The United States and New Zealand are the only countries in the\nworld\n[https://www.health.harvard.edu/medications/do-not-get-sold-on-drug-advertising#:~:text=How%20drug%20ads%20work,guidelines%20relating%20to%20broadcast%20media.]\nthat allow direct-to-consumer marketing for prescription drugs. No matter what\nsafeguards are in place, as long as companies can combine them, habit-forming\nmedications and AI ad targeting will make a deadly cocktail.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlbert Fox Cahn [https://www.businessinsider.com/author/albert-fox-cahn] is the\nfounder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project,\nor S.T.O.P., a New York-based civil-rights and privacy group."

But Health\nMinister Terrence Deyalsingh called on the population to not panic.\n\nIn giving the assurance that the public health system was prepared for mpox,\nDeyalsingh also noted the disease is spread by very close, usually sexual\ncontact, and “is not like Covid-19”.\n\nIn a telephone interview with the Express, he said preparations would have been\nmade previously with the Caura Hospital which is ready to accommodate mpox\ncases.\n\nThe confirmed cases in this country are in home isolation, and of primary\nconcern would be people who have been in very close contact with the patients.\n\nThe Ministry of Health stated in a release yesterday that subsequent to its\nannouncement on Tuesday of a confirmed infection, it advised that “a second case\nof monkeypox (Mpox) ­virus was confirmed via laboratory testing earlier today.\nThe patient is a young adult male”.\n\nHowever, Deyalsingh noted the nature of mpox’s contagion, and said the general\npublic should not be alarmed. He said T&T was “well-prepared to deal with\nindividual cases”, with testing equipment, vaccines and protocols at the ready.\n\nThe ministry announced on Tuesday that the first confirmed mpox patient was a\nmiddle-aged man with a history of international travel.\n\nDeyalsingh said the public health system was prepared to vaccinate the close\ncontacts of the two confirmed cases if necessary.\n\n“We had already assigned Caura as a ­designated health facility just in case any\n­person isolating were to become seriously ill or decompensate,” Deyalsingh\nsaid, referring to possible heart failure and fluid build-up in the body.\n\nThe ministry stated yesterday that “the relevant County Medical Officer of\nHealth (CMOH) is currently conducting an epidemiology investigation and has\ninitiated the local public health response, which includes home isolation and\ncontact tracing for the patient”.\n\nDeyalsingh advised the public that mpox is “a vastly different virus to\nCovid-19” and is spread between infected and non-infected people “primarily\nthrough very close, intimate physical contact, typically during sexual\nintercourse.\n\n“The risk to the general population is extremely, extremely small,” he said.\n\nHe said there is “no need” for public health protocols like what applied during\nthe Covid-19 pandemic, such as travel and movement restrictions and\nmask-wearing.\n\n“Nothing of the sort,” Deyalsingh said, adding that “life in T&T for the vast\nmajority goes on as usual”.\n\nHe said only close contacts of the cases in home isolation were affected and\nthey have been advised to isolate and vaccinate.\n\nAsked how the two confirmed cases were detected locally, Deyalsingh noted that\nsymptoms of mpox may initially appear as the flu, such as fever, stuffy nose and\nheadache.\n\nAnyone experiencing these symptoms followed by fluid-filled skin\nlesions/pustules and rashes is advised to seek testing for mpox, he said.\n\nAsked if T&T was at any increased risk due to border porosity, the minister said\nmpox was a global phenomenon, but the virus was also appearing to be “burning\nitself out”.\n\nHe recalled that the current outbreak started outside Central Africa, starting\nin May 2022 and peaking in August last year.\n\nThere are around 89,000 cases in 112 countries, with some countries reporting\nhigher ­cases in the past month.\n\nHowever, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared in May 2023 that the\n“multi-country outbreak is no longer a Public Health Emergency of International\nConcern (PHEIC), given the sustained decline in ­cases”.\n\nDeyalsingh said T&T was recording its first cases and the virus was still in\ncirculation, but noted global statistics, adding: “It’s not a cause for national\nalarm.”\n\nThe Ministry of Health said it will continue to provide updates to the public as\nnecessary.\n\nAdditional information on the monkeypox virus can be found on the ministry’s\nwebsite at www.health.gov.tt/monkeypox [http://www.health.gov.tt/monkeypox]."

The research suggests vigilance in monitoring this group for\nPAD and encouraging cessation.\n\n\nTHE RESEARCH EMPHASIZES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TIMELY AND REGULAR SCREENING FOR\nINDIVIDUALS WHO USE MARIJUANA.\n\nA study recently presented at the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography &\nInterventions (SCAI) 2023 Scientific Sessions highlights the connection between\nmarijuana use and peripheral artery disease (PAD). The study’s results suggested\nthat marijuana users are significantly more likely to develop PAD compared to\nthose in the broader population.\n\nWith nearly 50 million individuals reportedly using marijuana at least once,\naccording to the CDC, its usage has seen a rise in recent years.\n\nWhile many studies have looked at the impact of marijuana use on health, little\nresearch has been done to study the effect of marijuana use on the vascular\nsystem. PAD, a condition in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the\narms or legs, impacts 6.5 million people in the U.S. and can lead to a loss of\nmobility, reduced quality of life, heart attack, stroke, and death, if not\ntreated early.\n\nResearchers used de-identified patient data from the National Inpatient Samples\n(NIS) from 2016-2019 who reported marijuana use and a diagnosis of PAD. Patients\nwere further stratified based on any percutaneous lower extremity vascular\nintervention. The data was analyzed using SPSS software in a binary logistic\nregression model, a p-value <0.001 was considered statistically significant, and\nsamples were standardized for comparison using predicted probabilities.\n\nOf the 30 million patients identified, 623,768 were diagnosed as marijuana\nusers. Patients had an average age of 37.4 years, equal distribution across\ngenders, were more likely to be white and more likely to be elective admissions.\nOf these patients, 2,424 (0.38%) were also diagnosed with PAD. Marijuana users\nwere at more than three times the risk of developing PAD (OR= 3.68, p<0.001) but\nhad no statistically significant increased risk for mortality or requiring\npercutaneous intervention (p<0.001).\n\n“With the increase in marijuana use in the U.S., our findings show that users\nshould be aware of the symptoms of PAD such as leg pain while walking, slower or\nno hair growth, and feelings of coldness in the leg,” said Hirva Vyas, DO,\nHackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ and lead author of the\nstudy. “We know PAD is a progressive disease that can drastically impact the\nquality of life, making ongoing monitoring of this patient population critical.”\n\nAuthors note that based on study results, vigilant monitoring for disease\nscreening and progression should be initiated earlier in the outpatient setting\nin addition to cessation counseling.\n\nReference: “Impact of Marijuana Use on Prevalence and Interventions in\nPeripheral Artery Disease”, 18 May 2023, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography\n& Interventions (SCAI) 2023 Scientific Sessions."

Coli but have not yet found it. The investigators have initiated\ntraceback efforts, according to an FDA notice, but the agency has not reported\nwhat food or foods are being traced.\n\nThe FDA has not released any patient information, including where the patients\nlive.\n\nOther outbreak news\nIn an outbreak of infections from the microscopic parasite Cyclospora, the FDA\nhas initiated onsite inspections and has begun sample collection and analysis,\nHowever, the agency has not reported what location is being inspected or what\nfood is being sampled. \n\nThe case count in the outbreak has increased from 37 patients a week ago to 38\npatients this week. The FDA has not released any patient information, including\nwhere the patients live.\n\nIn a separate outbreak of Cyclospora infections, the patient count has increased\nfrom 105 last week to 112 this week.\n\nCyclospora parasites are often associated with various types of fresh produce,\nincluding basil, cilantro, mesclun lettuce, raspberries, and snow peas. Food\nsafety experts say washing products does not remove the parasite.\n\nIn the third outbreak from the Cyclospora parasite at least 210 people across 22\nstates have been sickened. Public health officials have not yet determined the\nsource of the parasite.\n\nFederal, state and local public health officials are investigating the outbreak,\naccording to an update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC and the Food and Drug Administration have been tracking the outbreak\nsince April 1. Additional infections could have started before that date. \n\nAlso, there are likely more than 210 people in the ongoing outbreak because of\nthe lag time between when patients become ill and when confirmation testing can\nbe completed and results filed with the CDC. Some sick people don’t seek medical\nattention, which also impacts the outbreak count. The parasite is killed by\nusing antibiotics. Specific tests are required to diagnose Cyclospora\ninfections, which can mimic other illnesses.\n\nAbout Cyclospora infections\nAnyone who has developed symptoms of Cyclospora infection, and has reason to\nbelieve they have been exposed to the parasite, should seek medical attention.\nSpecific tests are required and antibiotics are used to fight the parasite.\n\nCyclospora infection can cause severe abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, nausea,\nvomiting, body aches, and fatigue. Symptoms can develop between two and 14 days\nafter exposure. Though symptoms can be severe enough to send people to the\nhospital, it’s rare for people to die from Cyclospora infections. \n\nCyclospora is a type of protozoa, which is a tiny, single-celled organism. It is\ntransmitted when people ingest contaminated feces, typically through\ncontaminated food or water. It can be spread only through human waste, unlike E.\ncoli and Salmonella, which can also be spread from animal fecal matter.\n\n(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click\n[https://www.foodsafetynews.com/subscribe/#.VtSWqcdln_R] here)"

That’s the result of a\nsurvey of data [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6309344/] that\nconcluded far too many people lack access to treatment. High drug prices can\nlimit the availability of the medication.\n\nIf that weren’t bad enough, the CDC reckons around 40% of those with hepatitis C\nin the US are unaware of their status. They have no idea of the serious damage\nit could be doing to their bodies.\n\nA breakthrough medication became available for hepatitis C in the early ’00s.\nHowever, as this survey shows, a worrying number of US citizens have been unable\nto take advantage of it.\n\n\n“JARRINGLY LOW”\n\nCarolyn Wester, MD, MPH, director of the CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis,\ncalled the 34% cured figure “jarringly low” in a recent press conference to\nannounce the results. Those aged 20-29 were least likely to be cleared of the\nvirus.\n\nOf the 1.7 million diagnosed with hepatitis C, half had commercial health\ninsurance. A further 23% were covered by another payer — including self-payers —\n11% by Medicaid, 9% by an unspecified payer and 8% by Medicare.\n\nThose who had insurance through “another payer” were more likely to fall into\nthe “not cured” camp. Those most likely cured were older and covered by\ncommercial insurance plans.\n\nWester says some insurance plans restrict who is covered for hepatitis C\nmedication. Or they require “burdensome preauthorization” before treatment can\ncommence.\n\n“All of these restrictions can delay or even prohibit access to these lifesaving\nmedications,” she said.\n\n“Overcoming these barriers can mean the difference between life and death.\nEveryone with hepatitis C deserves the chance to be cured.”\n\nHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Alcohol and other toxins can cause\nthe condition, but it’s usually caused by a viral infection. The viral hepatitis\nsub-groups are A, B and C.\n\nHepatitis A is the milder form of the disease and most people will recover with\nor without treatment. There are vaccines to protect against hepatitis A and B.\nHowever, there is no vaccine for C: the most serious form of the illness.\n\nHepatitis C is caused by a virus and is often called the “silent killer”. This\nis because symptoms (fatigue, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, dark urine) only\nbegin to appear after the liver becomes significantly damaged, and that can take\nyears.\n\nHowever, just because you’re not experiencing symptoms, it doesn’t mean you\nshould postpone treatment. The virus is quietly wrecking your liver and setting\nyou up for future health issues.\n\nMost people who become infected with the virus develop chronic hepatitis C. It\nis a leading cause of liver transplants and liver cancer. However, the CDC\n[https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/abc/index.htm] says that if caught early,\nhepatitis C is “curable in more than 95% of cases.”\n\n\nWHY SHOULD GAY MEN BE CONCERNED?\n\nGay men are disproportionately represented in the hepatitis statistics. For\nexample, they make up around 20% of all new hepatitis B cases.\n\nBlood-to-blood contact is the main route of transmission for hepatitis C. It\nonly takes a microscopic amount for transmission to occur. Poor infection\ncontrol has caused outbreaks in health facilities while sharing needles or\nsyringes puts drug users at risk. Tattooists and body piercers who don’t\nproperly sterilize their equipment have also been linked to cases\n\nHepatitis experts also warn\n[https://britishlivertrust.org.uk/british-liver-trust-urges-cocaine-users-to-get-tested-for-hepatitis-c/]\nthat anyone who shares banknotes or straws to snort cocaine consider testing.\nNasal cavities are rich with blood capillaries, and it only take a tiny amount\nof blood on a straw to spread the hepatitis C virus.\n\nIt was previously thought that hepatitis C was not sexually transmitted.\nHowever, it’s now accepted that some transmission can occur through sex,\nparticularly if there is a risk of bleeding.\n\nThe number of cases of sexual transmission may be relatively low, but if you\nengage in fisting, rough sex, share sex toys, or take part in group sex, you’re\nmore at risk of hepatitis C.\n\nFor example, if you put a sex toy inside someone who has hepatitis C, and a\nsmall amount of blood gets on that toy, and you then put that toy inside\nyourself or someone else, transmission can occur.\n\nYour physician may not ask you detailed questions about your sex life, and you\nmay have little desire to volunteer such details. However, if you have any\nconcerns, ask your doc about taking a test. You can live with hepatitis C for\ndecades before you begin to fall ill, but the sooner you receive a diagnosis,\nand get medication, the better.\n\nHepatitis C can be fatal if left untreated.\n\n\nGET QUEERTY DAILY\n\nSubscribe to Queerty for a daily dose of #life #cure #gaymen stories and more"

        "content": "Summary: Avoiding activities associated with past pain can cause individuals to\nshun related tasks that might be painless. This avoidance may generalize to safe\nactivities, leading to needless abstention from valued activities.\n\nThe study conducted on healthy individuals reveals that this generalization\nextends to both physically similar and conceptually related tasks.\n\nThe findings highlight the need for a deeper understanding of pain avoidance to\nimprove treatment outcomes for those with chronic pain.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n 1. The study reveals that avoidance of pain can generalize to conceptually\n    related activities that may be performed painlessly.\n 2. This research indicates that generalized avoidance may be based on the\n    conceptual similarities individuals assign to tasks.\n 3. Psychological factors, rather than physical injury severity, are better\n    predictors of chronic pain, emphasizing the need for further exploration of\n    pain avoidance generalization.\n\nSource: APS\n\nChronic pain can seriously restrict our lives, preventing us from reaching our\nfull professional potential, enjoying hobbies, and even participating in\nmeaningful life events with friends and family out of fear that certain\nactivities may lead to additional pain and suffering. Avoiding experiences\nassociated with pain can be an adaptive behavior.\n\nBut, as Eveliina Glogan, Peixin Liu, and Ann Meulders (Maastricht University)\ndemonstrate in a recent Psychological Science article, when we learn to avoid\none activity that has caused pain in the past, it can also lead us to avoid\nconceptually related activities that we may be able to complete painlessly. \n\nThis shows a woman\n[https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2023/07/pain-conceptual-linking-neurosicn.jpg]\nThey also reported higher fear and pain expectations related to taking the\ndirect route during the new tasks from the safe category than during familiar\nsafe tasks. Credit: Neuroscience News\n\n“When avoidance generalizes to such safe movements and activities, it can become\nproblematic,” Glogan said in an interview.\n\n“For example, needless avoidance can come at the cost of other valued\nactivities, such as playing with one’s children, and can even culminate in\ndisability due to reduced activity levels.”\n\nThis generalization can extend not only to physically similar tasks (e.g., from\nmopping to vacuuming) but also across entire categories of conceptually related\nactivities, such as cleaning or sports. \n\nGlogan, Liu, and Meulders investigated how generalized avoidance occurs in\nhealthy individuals through a study of 40 people without chronic pain. \n\nTo establish what they consired a painful shock, each participant wore a set of\ntwo electrodes that delivered increasingly strong electric shocks. Once the\nparticipant rated the pain as an 8 out of 10 in severity (described as\n“significantly painful and demanding some effort to tolerate”), the shocks\nstopped and the practice phase of the experiment began. \n\nDuring this phase, participants were instructed to complete digital “gardening”\nand “cleaning” tasks by using a joystick to move a tool, such as a wheelbarrow\nor a mop, toward an appropriate item, such as a pile of grass or puddle of\nwater, across a computer screen.\n\nIn the first eight practice trials, participants were able to choose one of two\nroutes to the item: a direct, efficient route that allowed them to complete the\ntask with one movement of the joystick and a longer, inefficient route that\nrequired them to move the tool to the item twice. \n\nIn the subsequent acquisition trials, however, every time participants completed\nthe tasks from one category (mopping and vacuuming for cleaning or raking and\nusing a wheelbarrow for gardening), they were 80% likely to receive a painful\nshock while using the direct route.\n\nBut they never received a shock while using the indirect route or while\ncompleting tasks from the other category (the “safe” category). Before each\ntrial, participants used a scale of 0 to 100 to report how painful they expected\neach route to be and how fearful they were of using them. \n\nOnce participants had the opportunity to learn about which tasks were likely to\ncause pain, they completed a generalization phase that included a mix of eight\nadditional gardening and cleaning tasks and the same measures of expected pain\nand fear.\n\nAlthough mopping/vacuuming or raking/wheelbarrowing using the direct route\ncontinued to result in a painful shock, participants could complete the new\ntasks from both categories using either route without getting zapped. \n\nBy the end of the acquisition phase, participants were more than 5 times more\nlikely to choose the longer, pain-free route to complete tasks in which the\ndirect route had previously resulted in them getting shocked.\n\nParticipants also reported higher pain expectations and fear in relation to the\ndirect route before completing these tasks, and these higher pain expectations\nand fear extended to tasks that had never resulted in pain, albeit to a lesser\nextent.\n\nThis suggests that although participants had learned to fear experiencing pain\non the direct route during certain tasks, they were not entirely certain that\nthe “safe” tasks were really safe either, Glogan and colleagues wrote.\n\nBy the end of the experiment, the avoidance of previously painful actions had\nalso generalized to other tasks in the same category even though using the\ndirect route to complete these tasks never resulted in experiencing pain.\n\nOverall, participants were 1.8 times more likely to take the indirect route when\ncompleting new tasks from the same category as previously painful tasks—for\nexample, cleaning activities like washing dishes or dusting if taking the direct\npath to mopping and vacuuming had previously caused them pain—than they were\nduring new tasks from the safe category. \n\nAdditionally, participants reported fearing and expecting more pain from the\ndirect route during the new tasks from the pain-associated category than from\nthe safe category.\n\nThey also reported higher fear and pain expectations related to taking the\ndirect route during the new tasks from the safe category than during familiar\nsafe tasks. \n\nAlthough Glogan and colleagues’ previous research supports the view that people\ngeneralize pain expectations across categories of activities according to their\nperceptual similarities, this research suggests that generalized avoidance may\nalso be based on the conceptual similarities individuals assign to tasks, Glogan\nexplained in the interview.\n\nThis amounts to the difference between perceptually linking vacuuming and\nmopping because they involve physically similar movements and conceptually\nlinking mopping, dishwashing, and dusting because they are related to the same\ncategory—cleaning. \n\nPsychological factors, rather than physical ones like the severity of an injury,\nhave been shown to be the best predictors of which patients will experience\nchronic pain, Meulders said in a separate interview, so increasing our\nunderstanding of how pain avoidance generalizes could help improve treatment\noutcomes. \n\n“Fears and avoidant behavior can spread in idiosyncratic ways, and it’s so\nimportant to tap into those semantic networks and find out the specific\ncategories that people have if you want to treat them,” Meulders added. \n\nFuture work is needed to explore how these findings may apply to people with\nchronic pain, who are thought to generalize pain avoidance more broadly than\nhealthy individuals, Glogan and Meulders said. \n\n\nABOUT THIS PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH NEWS\n\nAuthor: Leah Thayer\n[https://neurosciencenews.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#127e667a736b77605262616b717a7d7e7d757b71737e61717b777c71773c7d6075]\nSource: APS [https://psychologicalscience.org/]\nContact: Leah Thayer – APS\nImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n“Generalization of costly pain-related avoidance based on real-life categorical\nknowledge [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976231170878]” by\nEveliina Glogan et al. Psychological Science\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbstract\n\nGeneralization of costly pain-related avoidance based on real-life categorical\nknowledge\n\nAvoiding activities posing bodily threat is adaptive. However, spreading of\navoidance to safe activities may cause functional disability in people with\nchronic pain.\n\nWe investigated whether costly pain-related avoidance would generalize from one\nactivity to another on the basis of real-life categorical knowledge in 40\npain-free people (30 female; mean age = 25 years; university students and public\nof Maastricht, The Netherlands). In a computer task, participants moved a\njoystick to complete activities from two categories (gardening and cleaning).\n\nDuring activities from the avoidance category, pain could be avoided at the cost\nof task efficiency by deviating from a short, pain-associated joystick movement.\nActivities from the safe category were never painful. Subsequently, we tested\ngeneralization of avoidance to novel pain-free activities from both categories.\n\nParticipants generalized avoidance to novel activities from the avoidance\ncategory despite the novel activities not being paired with pain and despite\navoidance costs, suggesting that costly (pain-related) avoidance generalizes\nfrom one activity to another on the basis of category knowledge and can thus be\nwide reaching, creating detrimental consequences."

        "content": "Dr. Peter Barkett\n\nMy patients ask me all sorts of questions, but one that I hear commonly is “Can\nI stop any of my medications?” This is a great question to bring up with a\nmedical professional because we are more often focused on prescribing\nmedications than deprescribing them. All medications can have benefits when\nselected for appropriate patients, and most prescriptions are well-tolerated,\nbut most also carry some risk of side effects. Clinicians try to weigh risks and\nbenefits at the time of prescribing.\n\nSometimes as a patient’s situation, age or health changes, that risk-benefit\ncalculation for a medication changes as well. So, it is important to also\nconsider when a medication may no longer be necessary or find out if the\nguidelines for regular use have changed. This includes some common\nover-the-counter medications which some people take regularly. Your healthcare\nteam should be consulted or notified when you intend to make a change since many\nmedications should not be stopped abruptly or have benefits that might not be\nobvious (the “I feel better so maybe I don’t need this anymore” question). It’s\nbest to talk to your health care provider about your specific situation and\nhealth before stopping most medications.\n\nHere are some medications, both prescription and over the counter, it may be\ntime to ask your health care team about. (I’ll include brand names to help\nreaders recognize medications, but this information applies to generics and\nother brands of these drugs).\n\nPeter Barkett\n[https://www.kitsapsun.com/gcdn/presto/2020/03/12/PBKS/faa0e774-1575-4b38-aaaa-35e9bd5fe550-barkett-peter_C2B7112resize.jpg?width=300&height=450&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp]\n * Antihistamines. These medications can be very helpful reducing symptoms\n   during allergy season, but most patients don’t need them indefinitely.\n   First-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and\n   hydroxyzine (Atarax) also have high rates of side effects like dry mouth, dry\n   eyes, constipation, difficulty urinating and even confusion. The\n   second-generation antihistamines like loratadine, fexofenadine and cetirizine\n   (often known under brand names Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec) are less likely\n   to cause these side effects and can be good alternatives, particularly for\n   more frequent use. But even the second-generation products may not be\n   necessary for use year-round. If your symptoms are well-controlled, it may be\n   reasonable to transition to as needed or seasonal use.\n\n * Heartburn medications. The medical term for heartburn is gastroesophageal\n   reflux (GERD). It can be very unpleasant and, fortunately, it is limited for\n   most people. There are two types of medications commonly used to treat\n   symptoms, both available over the counter without a prescription. Proton pump\n   inhibitors (PPIs) include omeprazole (Prilosec) and pantoprazole (Protonix)\n   and work to reduce stomach acid. They work great for patients experiencing\n   frequent GERD symptoms who require a daily treatment.However, some patients\n   may no longer need them after decreases in weight or changes in lifestyle\n   that help resolve the GERD. Keep in mind, there are some situations when\n   stopping these medications would not be advisable such as for patients with a\n   history of stomach ulcers or in whom GERD has caused changes in the\n   esophagus.The other class of medications for GERD are H2 blockers and include\n   ranitidine (Zantac) and famotidine (Pepcid). They are also available over the\n   counter and can take effect faster than PPIs, so if your healthcare team does\n   approve a trial of going off of other GERD medication, you have an option for\n   quick relief on an as-needed basis should symptoms return.\n\n * Antibiotics before dental procedures. In the past, antibiotics have been\n   recommended to some patients for use before routine dental visits. This is\n   only rarely still the recommendation; one case where it is recommended is for\n   patients with mechanical heart valves. But it is no longer the recommendation\n   for the majority of patients, including those with a history of joint\n   replacement. This question has been studied by health researchers and the\n   data is clear. The American Academy of Orthopedics Surgery recommends against\n   routine use of antibiotics before dentist appointments in patients with joint\n   replacements. Such use of antibiotics has not been shown to improve health\n   outcomes. Overuse of antibiotics can risk side effects like diarrhea or yeast\n   infections while also stimulating antibiotic resistance.\n\n * Aspirin. Many patients started taking aspirin years ago after its health\n   benefits reducing heart attacks and strokes was discovered. Yet, aspirin can\n   increase the risk of bleeding and stomach ulcers. So, the size of the benefit\n   for each patient needs to be considered. People with a history of heart\n   disease or stroke see the greatest benefit and generally should not stop\n   aspirin. Patients without that history are at an average risk of heart\n   disease or stroke, so they get less benefit but the same amount of risk. On\n   the other hand, statin medications can have a greater benefit with less risk\n   and may be a better option to prevent a first heart attack or stroke.\n\n * Statins after age 74. I prescribe statin medications because they can have\n   substantial benefit but carry relatively little risk. Statin medications like\n   rosuvastatin (Crestor) and atorvastatin (Lipitor) work to reduce cholesterol\n   and reverse plaque formation in the arteries. This lowers the chances of\n   heart attack or stroke – by near 50% at higher doses. The most common side\n   effect of statins is pain in the muscles. If this occurs, it will stop with\n   stopping the medication but will also often resolve with vitamin D\n   replacement as well.The effect of statins on arteries and atherosclerotic\n   disease is so significant that the benefits often linger for many years after\n   stopping the medication. That is why we can usually safely stop the\n   medication in patients older than age 74 who do not have a diagnosis of prior\n   heart disease or stroke. These patients can coast for many years on the\n   benefit they have already received from prior usage of the medication.\n\n * Sleep aids. Supplements like melatonin can help some people to get sleep\n   habits back on track, but more powerful sleeping pills like zolpidem (Ambien)\n   and eszopiclone (Lunesta) can alter natural sleep patterns and over time\n   create a dependency. Fortunately, sleep is both a biologic process and a\n   habit which responds to lifestyle adjustments and consistent patterns.\n   Patients who started on a powerful sleeping pill when sleep patterns were\n   disrupted often do not need to continue on these medicines indefinitely.\n   Working to improve sleep health can make the prescriptions unnecessary, and\n   it makes sense to try tapering them gradually with the guidance of a\n   healthcare professional.\n\n * Hormone replacement therapy. Oral estrogen therapy was once a popular way to\n   manage the symptoms of menopause. However, we now know this carries\n   significant risks, including heart disease, blood clots and certain cancers.\n   We also know that alternative medications are often effective. Over time, the\n   intensity of symptoms may also wane. If you have been taking oral estrogen\n   therapy for menopausal symptoms, you could consider working with your\n   clinician to taper or replace hormonal therapy.\n\n * Testosterone supplementation. Declines in testosterone levels in men are\n   often not as sudden as declines in estrogen during female menopause. Still\n   many men experience symptoms and start testosterone therapy. Testosterone may\n   cause blood clots, elevated blood pressure, cardiovascular events,\n   enlargement of the prostate and sleep apnea. Like with estrogen therapy, talk\n   with your provider about other approaches or treatments for your situation.\n\nThis summer I am doing some traveling, and I think it offers a good metaphor for\nthinking about medications. When I travel, I hate to leave something important\nat home, so I can tend to “overpack.” On the other hand, I really don’t like\nlugging a heavy bag around the airport, so while packing I try to ask myself “do\nI really need to bring this?” There is a similar push and pull when it comes to\nmedications.\n\nPrescriptions and over-the counter medications can improve health and wellbeing,\nbut they also bring cost, inconvenience and the chance for side effects. Every\nperson is different and has individual health needs and responses to\nmedications. An individual’s situation will also evolve over time. Just like\nchecking in regularly with wellness exams, regularly evaluating the benefits of\nmedications with possible risks helps to keep you in your best health.\n\nPeter Barkett, MD, practices internal medicine at Kaiser Permanente Silverdale.\nHe lives in Bremerton."

Credit: Neuroscience News\n\nWorking in zebrafish and mice, the team discovered that a signal originating\nfrom a gene in neurons is essential for the proper formation of the blood-brain\nbarrier during embryonic development and helps ensure that the barrier remains\nintact throughout adulthood.\n\nIf replicated in further animal testing and eventually in humans, the findings\ncould help scientists control the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. In\ndoing so, researchers may be able to develop more effective ways of delivering\ncancer or psychiatric medicines into the brain and better strategies for\ncombating barrier damage caused by neurodegeneration or stroke.    \n\nFollowing the science\n\nThe blood-brain barrier is made of tightly interlaced cells — endothelial cells,\npericytes, and astrocytes — lining the blood vessels of the brain and spinal\ncord that make up the central nervous system. Together, these cells form a\nlayered, semipermeable membrane that selectively lets in nutrients and small\nmolecules, while keeping out harmful substances. \n\n“In normal, day-to-day life, you need a blood-brain barrier to help protect you\nfrom invading toxins and pathogens in the blood,” explained lead author Natasha\nO’Brown, a research fellow in systems biology at HMS who is starting her lab at\nRutgers University in September.   \n\nIn the case of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, or\nstroke, the barrier begins to break down, leaving the central nervous system\nsusceptible to infection. On the flip side, the impermeability of the barrier\npresents an obstacle for delivering drugs to the brain.\n\nFor decades, scientists have known that the permeability of the blood-brain\nbarrier is in part controlled by cells in the surrounding environment — known as\nthe microenvironment. However, the genes in those nearby cells have largely\nremained a mystery.\n\nUnbeknownst to the researchers, a major clue was swimming around inside fish\ntanks in the lab of senior author Sean Megason, professor of systems biology in\nthe Blavatnik Institute at HMS.\n\nO’Brown was studying a gene called \n[https://elifesciences.org/articles/47326]mfsd2aa that, when mutated, causes the\nblood-brain barrier in zebrafish to become leaky throughout the entire brain.\nHowever, she noticed that some zebrafish had a barrier that was permeable in the\nforebrain and midbrain, but intact in the hindbrain.\n\n“This observation led me down a rabbit hole of finding the gene that causes the\nblood-brain barrier to become regionally permeable,” she said.\n\nA new character emerges\n\nO’Brown conducted genetic screens on the zebrafish and discovered that the\nregion-specific breakdown of the barrier was linked to a mutation in spock1 — a\ngene whose name brought to mind the Star Trek character but was otherwise\nunfamiliar to her.\n\nIn a series of experiments in zebrafish and mice, O’Brown confirmed that\na spock1 mutation caused the blood-brain barrier to become permeable in some\nareas but not others. She also saw that spock1 was expressed in neurons\nthroughout the retina, brain, and spinal cord, but not in the cells that make up\nthe barrier itself.\n\nIn follow-up experiments, animals with a spock1 mutation had more vesicles —\nintercellular bubbles that can carry large molecules across the blood-brain\nbarrier — in their endothelial cells. They also had a smaller basement membrane,\na network of proteins found between endothelial cells and pericytes in the\nbarrier.\n\nCell-by-cell RNA analysis revealed that spock1 caused changes in gene expression\nin endothelial cells and pericytes in the blood-brain barrier, but not in other\ncell types in the brain.\n\nWhen O’Brown injected a dose of human SPOCK1 protein into zebrafish brains, it\nrestored around 50 percent of blood-brain barrier function by repairing\npericyte–endothelial cell interactions at a molecular level.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers concluded that the Spock1 protein\nproduced by neurons travels to the blood-brain barrier, where it initiates the\nproper formation of the barrier during development and helps maintain the\nbarrier after.\n\n“Spock1 is a potent secreted neural signal that is able to promote and induce\nbarrier properties in these blood vessels; without it, you don’t get a\nfunctional blood-brain barrier,” O’Brown said. “It’s like a spark on a gas\nstove, providing a cue that tells the barrier program to turn on.”\n\nCompleting the picture\n\nThe study adds to a growing body of research by renowned blood-brain barrier\nbiologist Chenghua Gu, professor of neurobiology at HMS, investigator at the\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute, and an author on the new paper.\n\nHer lab has been studying a cellular trafficking system that seems to regulate\nblood-brain barrier permeability through Mfsd2a, and exploring other aspects of\nthe microenvironment that may be involved. Cumulatively, the work is providing\nscientists with an increasingly complete picture of how the blood-brain barrier\nfunctions.\n\nGaining this complete picture is essential as researchers attempt to manipulate\nthe permeability of the barrier. For drug delivery, they often want to make the\nbarrier more permeable, so therapies known to be effective for cancer or\npsychiatric disorders can reach the brain and do their jobs.\n\nFor neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s or situations\nlike stroke, scientists want to counter the associated deterioration of the\nblood-brain barrier that makes the central nervous system vulnerable to external\nassaults. \n\nO’Brown noted that spock1 is an especially appealing target for controlling the\nproperties of the blood-brain barrier because it is conserved in humans and\nseems to act as a high-level regulator of barrier cells during development.\n\nShe now wants to explore how different lineages of pericytes in the barrier are\ndifferentially affected by spock1 signaling. She would also like to test out\nstroke models, to see if administering spock1 can counter a stroke’s effects on\nthe blood-brain barrier.\n\n“This isn’t the first neural signal scientists have found, but it is the first\nsignal from neurons that specifically seems to regulate barrier properties,”\nO’Brown said. “I think this makes it a potent tool to try and toggle the\nswitch.”\n\nAuthorship, funding, disclosures\n\nAdditional authors on the paper include Nikit Patel and Allon Klein of HMS, and\nUrsula Hartmann of the University of Cologne.\n\nFunding: The research was supported by the Damon Runyon Cancer Research\nFoundation, the National Institutes of Health (K99HD103911; R01HD096755;\nR35NS116820), an Allen Distinguished Investigator Award, and a Faculty Scholar\ngrant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\n\nABOUT THIS GENETICS AND NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH NEWS\n\nAuthor: Dennis Nealon\n[https://neurosciencenews.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89edece7e7e0fad6e7ece8e5e6e7c9e1e4faa7e1e8fbffe8fbeda7ecedfc]\nSource: Harvard\n[https://neurosciencenews.com/spock1-blood-brain-barrier-23615/://hms.harvard.edu]\nContact: Dennis Nealon – Harvard\nImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n“The secreted neuronal signal Spock1 promotes blood-brain barrier development\n[https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1534580723003039]” by Natasha\nO’Brown et al. Developmental Cell\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbstract\n\nThe secreted neuronal signal Spock1 promotes blood-brain barrier development\n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a unique set of properties of the\nbrain vasculature which severely restrict its permeability to proteins and small\nmolecules. Classic chick-quail chimera studies have shown that these properties\nare not intrinsic to the brain vasculature but rather are induced by surrounding\nneural tissue.\n\nHere, we identify Spock1 as a candidate neuronal signal for regulating BBB\npermeability in zebrafish and mice. Mosaic genetic analysis shows that\nneuronally expressed Spock1 is cell non-autonomously required for a functional\nBBB.\n\nLeakage in spock1 mutants is associated with altered extracellular matrix (ECM),\nincreased endothelial transcytosis, and altered pericyte-endothelial\ninteractions. Furthermore, a single dose of recombinant SPOCK1 partially\nrestores BBB function in spock1 mutants by quenching gelatinase activity and\nrestoring vascular expression of BBB genes including mcamb.\n\nThese analyses support a model in which neuronally secreted Spock1 initiates BBB\nproperties by altering the ECM, thereby regulating pericyte-endothelial\ninteractions and downstream vascular gene expression."

        "content": "(CNN) — People spread the virus that causes Covid-19 to wild white-tailed deer\nin the United States more than 100 times in late 2021 and early 2022, according\nto a new study from the US Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health\nInspection Service. The infection circulated widely in the deer population, and\nin at least three instances, researchers suspect that humans caught the virus\nfrom deer.\n\nThe study also found that many coronavirus lineages such as Alpha, Delta and\nOmicron continued to circulate in deer after they’d left the human population.\n\nIf the virus continues to circulate in deer, as it has in humans, the study\nsuggests that these animals could become a long-term reservoir, allowing the\nvirus to hide out and develop new and potentially more dangerous mutations.\n\nScientists fear that those viruses could then jump back into the human\npopulation and spark another severe wave, as they did when Omicron arrived\nseemingly out of the blue. Although that scenario is concerning, it’s still\nlargely theoretical.\n\nWatching animal reservoirs\n\nExperts say that a reservoir in wild animals would be a bigger deal if we’d\nactually managed to control the virus in humans. But the infection is still\nspreading among humans, and it’s most likely to mutate in us because we’re its\npreferred hosts.\n\n“The more species it’s in and the more transmission that occurs, the greater the\nrisk of new variants. However, it’s hard to say whether deer constitute much of\na risk in the grand scheme at this point,” said Scott Weese, a veterinarian who\nstudies diseases that pass between animals and people at the University of\nGuelph in Canada.\n\nThe US government plans to continue and expand its survey of animals to keep\ntabs on how the virus moves through animal populations, according to a USDA news\nrelease\n[https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2023/white-tailed-deer-research-sars-cov-2]\nannouncing the study results. The study\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39782-x] was published Monday in the\njournal Nature Communications.\n\n“We’d rather not have it in deer, to avoid one more potential mechanism for\nvariant emergence and to avoid exposure to even more wildlife species,” said\nWeese, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nBut there’s little we could do to stop it from spreading now, he\nsaid. Scientists sometimes vaccinate wild animal populations to prevent disease\nspread, but it’s an expensive proposition.\n\nJust like there’s no vaccine that completely prevents Covid-19 infections from\npassing between people, there’s no innoculation that prevents transmission in\nanimals.\n\nWhy deer?\n\nDeer and humans have strikingly similar ACE2 receptors, the gateways the virus\nuses to break into cells.\n\nFor the study, scientists spent months collecting nearly 9,000 respiratory swabs\nfrom wild deer in 26 states and the District of Columbia. Those swabs yielded\nnearly 400 viral sequences from 34 lineages of the virus that causes Covid-19.\nThey were able to closely compare those sequences to find viruses in people that\nwere very similar to those found in deer.\n\nIn 109 cases, researchers say, they were able to show that deer had been\ninfected by human viruses.\n\nContact between deer and humans\n\nIn at least three cases, human infections cataloged in databases closely matched\nthe genetic sequences of viruses previously carried by deer, leading researchers\nto suspect that those people could have caught their infections from the\nanimals.\n\nDeer have become common in the US, even in urban environments. Population\nsurveys have estimated America’s deer population at 30 million animals, who may\nhunt for food in human trash or drink from contaminated wastewater. Humans may\ncome into contact with deer directly while feeding or hunting them, or through\ndroppings. House cats who spend time outdoors could also act like a kind of\nintermediary, Weese says, catching the virus outside and bringing it home with\nthem.\n\nCats are susceptible to the virus too, as are many other species that are farmed\n– such as mink – or kept in zoos.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a person’s risk of\ncatching Covid-19 from domestic or wild animals is low. The agency advises that\ncertain groups, such as hunters, take special precautions\n[https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/covid-19/wildlife.html#hunters] to further\nlower their risk.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

(Photo via\nGetty Images)\n\n\n\n\nAN EXPERT WEIGHS IN\n\nTo get an expert's opinion on the topic, Yahoo Canada spoke to Dan Burton\n[https://www.instagram.com/theofficialdrdan/], a Weight Management Specialist\nand the founder of Health Evolved [https://healthevolved.co/].\n\nWhen asked about \"Ozempic butt,\" Burton pointed to a wider systemic issue at\nhand.\n\n\"I feel this is part of a bigger systemic issue of how our society is hyper\nfocused on what an individual's body looks like, versus what is on the inside,\"\nhe revealed.\n\nThe health expert added Ozempic can make a big impact on the lives of people who\nare trying to manage obesity. To him, headlines like \"Ozempic butt\" are\nsensationalized and cause people to feel bad about themselves for their weight.\n\n> Our society is hyper focused on what an individual's body looks like versus\n> what is on the inside.Dan Burton\n\nThat said, Burton explained loose skin is a normal reaction to weight loss by\nany method — whether it be through diet and exercise, or drugs like Ozempic.\n\n\"If a person goes on Ozempic and they lose enough weight, they can develop loose\nskin. However, it is not Ozempic that is causing it specifically, it's the loss\nof a significant amount of weight that leads to loose skin,\" he said.\n\nBurton added our skin has similar properties to an elastic band. When fat is\nremoved through weight loss, it becomes overstretched and unable to snap back to\nits original form.\n\nTo him, it's important to remember that saggy skin on any area of the body has\nbeen happening for years through various weight loss drugs or fad diets, not\njust from Ozempic.\n\nTo help prevent loose skin from Ozempic, Burton recommends people exercise and\nlift weights.

(Photo via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nHowever, he believes the people most likely to experience \"saggy butts\" are\nOzempic users with \"a larger amount of fat and/or weight loss from their gluteal\nregion.\"\n\nIn summary, Ozempic is a drug that's often used for weight loss. While many\nTikTokers have seen dramatic transformations, it also comes with saggy skin —\nespecially on their butts.\n\nAfter investigating the trend, Burton revealed weight loss in general — not just\nfrom Ozempic — can cause someone's skin to become loose and flabby.\n\nWith this in mind, Yahoo Canada has partially debunked the trend. While taking\nthe drug can cause \"Ozempic butt,\" it's actually rapid weight loss that causes\nthe effect, not the medication itself.\n\nIf you experience saggy skin as a result of taking Ozempic, Burton has some tips\nto treat it.\n\n\"Hit the weights. Build some muscle. This will help to fill out areas where\nloose skin might develop,\" he said.\n\n\"Plus, lifting weights and building muscle is great for your health and can help\nwith weight maintenance.\"\n\nLet us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA\n[https://twitter.com/yahoostyleca]!

        "content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by\nthe World Health Organization (WHO)1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR1]. During the course\nof the pandemic, it has become clear that the infection can lead to severe\ndisease and death, and also long-term sequelae labelled “post COVID-19” or “long\ncovid”2 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR2],3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR3],4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR4],5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR5]. The reported\nprevalence of post COVID-19 has been in a wide range from around 6% to close to\n100% among those with a confirmed disease2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR2],6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR6]. A recent review\nfound the prevalence in non-hospitalized patients to be between 7.5–41%7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR7], although the study\npopulations (e.g., age range) and definitions of post COVID-19 differed\nconsiderably between the different studies which could affect the prevalence4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR4]. WHO proposed the\nfollowing definition of post COVID-19 in December 2021: “Post COVID-19 condition\nis defined as the illness that occurs in people who have a history of probable\nor confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\ninfection; usually within three months from the onset of COVID-19, with symptoms\nand effects that last for at least two months”8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR8]. After the acute\ninfection has resolved, the remaining or upcoming symptoms are considered\nemanating from tissue injury caused by the virus itself, by the\nhyperinflammation caused by disease, or by post-infectious conditions related to\nthe disease but not directly caused by the viral effect (for example being\nbedbound or invasive ventilation)3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR3].\n\nPost COVID-19 is generally reported to be more common among females compared to\nmales6 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR6],9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR9],10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR10],11\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR11],12\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR12],13\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR13],14\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR14],15\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR15]. In addition,\nasthma has, in several studies, been found to associate to post COVID-194\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR4],10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR10],16\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR16]. Moreover, age\n(> 50 years), smoking, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, obesity,\nand psychiatric disease have also been associated with a higher risk for post\nCOVID-19 symptoms4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR4],7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR7],13\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR13],14\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR14],17\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR17],18\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR18],19\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR19]. The condition can\nbe present both after severe and mild disease2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR2],20\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR20], although the\nprevalence and symptom pattern may differ depending on severity21\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR21],22\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR22],23\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR23],24\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR24].\n\nHowever, most studies on post COVID-19 are based on clinical populations. Hence,\nin younger age groups, with predominantly mild disease, post COVID-19 symptoms\nand risk factors are less studied. The potential post COVID-19 burden in young\nadults is of importance both for health care providers and public, due to the\noften long duration of the symptoms and their debilitating effect at an age when\nit is common to both start a family and be in the beginning of a working life.\n\nIn the present study, we characterize the post COVID-19 symptomatology in young\nadults from a population-based cohort and investigate risk factors and clinical\ncharacteristics associated with post COVID-19 condition.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY POPULATION\n\nThe study population consisted of 2022 individuals with available information on\nconfirmed COVID-19 (i.e. positive test) and post COVID-19 symptoms (n = 1193\n(59.0%) women and n = 829 (41.0%) men). The mean age was 26.5 years (range\n24.9–27.9). A description of the study population is presented in Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Tab1].\n\nTable 1 Description of the study population (n = 2022).\n\nFull size table [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2/tables/1]\n\nThe prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was 33.7% (n = 681), with no difference\namong females (34.0%) and males (33.3%). Among them, around half (n = 356,\n52.3%) were identified through the national SmiNet register25\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR25], whereas the\nothers were based on self-reported positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR),\nantigen, or antibody test (antibody test taken before vaccination)\n(Supplementary Fig. 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#MOESM1] online). In total, 5\n(< 1%) of the participants with confirmed COVID-19 reported being admitted to\nhospital. There were few differences in sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, or\nchronic diseases/conditions between those with and without confirmed COVID-19\n(Supplementary Table S1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#MOESM1] and S2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#MOESM1] online).\n\n\nPREVALENCE OF POST COVID-19\n\nIn total, 112 (16.5%) of those with confirmed COVID-19 fulfilled the definition\nof post COVID-19 with no significant difference between females (17.8%) and\nmales (14.5%). This prevalence was similar in the group of COVID-19 cases\nidentified from the SmiNet register (16.3%, 58/356). When defining post COVID-19\nas symptoms lasting for at least 3 months, the prevalence was 15.0% among those\nwith confirmed COVID-19. Nineteen participants (2.8%) had been seeking\nhealthcare for post COVID-19 and only 3 participants (0.4%) had received a\ndiagnosis of post COVID-19 (Table 2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Tab2]). The overall\nprevalence of post COVID-19 in the total study population including both cases\nand non-cases of COVID-19 was 5.5% (112/2022).\n\nTable 2 Prevalence of reported long-term symptoms, health care consumption and\ndiagnosis of post COVID, by sex among participants with confirmed COVID-19a\n(n = 681).\n\nFull size table [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2/tables/2]\n\nAmong those with post COVID-19 (n = 112), the most common symptoms were altered\nsmell and taste (68.8%), dyspnea (33.7%) and fatigue (30.4%) (Fig. 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Fig1]). There was no\ndifference in type of symptoms between females and males (data not shown).\n\nFigure 1\nfigure 1\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-023-38315-2/MediaObjects/41598_2023_38315_Fig1_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2/figures/1\n\nPrevalence of specific long-term symptoms among participants with confirmed\nCOVID-19 and post COVID-19.

The upper\nX-axis designates percent of participants with post COVID-19 (n = 112), the\nlower percent of participants with confirmed COVID-19 (n = 681).\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2/figures/1]\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, LIFESTYLE FACTORS, AND CHRONIC DISEASES\nIN RELATION TO POST COVID-19\n\nThere were no differences in sociodemographic factors (sex, education,\noccupation, or living area) among participants with confirmed COVID-19 with and\nwithout post COVID-19. Being bedbound during COVID-19, especially for one week\nor more, was more common among those with post COVID-19. This was more\npronounced in the groups with symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue, Fig. 2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Fig2] and Supplementary\nTable S3 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#MOESM1] online for\nexact numbers. There was a high vaccination coverage for COVID-19, at over 90%\nwith at least one dose, not differing between the groups (data not shown).\n\nFigure 2\nfigure 2\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-023-38315-2/MediaObjects/41598_2023_38315_Fig2_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2/figures/2\n\nPercent of participants being bedbound during the COVID-19 disease in relation\nto post COVID-19. The figure shows the groups with and without post-COVID-19,\nand the groups with the three most prevalent specific symptoms of post COVID-19\n(altered smell or taste, dyspnea, and fatigue). All groups are compared to the\ngroup with no post COVID-19, as three categories (not being bedbound, bedbound\n1–6 days and bedbound ≥ 1 week). Significant differences are displayed in the\nfigure.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2/figures/2]\n\nEarly life factors were not related to post COVID-19 or to the specific post\nCOVID-19 symptoms altered taste or smell, dyspnea or fatigue (Supplementary\nTable S4 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#MOESM1] online). In\naddition, there was no significant difference in smoking or snuff use, assessed\nbefore the pandemic (Fig. 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Fig3]A, Supplementary Table\nS4 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#MOESM1] online). However,\nthe participants with post COVID-19 reported less often to have considered\nthemselves completely healthy before the pandemic, which was more pronounced and\nsignificant in the group with post COVID-19 symptoms of fatigue (45.5% n = 15,\ncompared to 66.2%, n = 370, among them with no post COVID-19, p = 0.015) (Fig. 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Fig3]A).\n\nFigure 3\nfigure 3\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-023-38315-2/MediaObjects/41598_2023_38315_Fig3_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2/figures/3\n\nPrevalence of lifestyle factors, chronic diseases, and other characteristics\nbefore the pandemic in relation to post COVID-19. The figure shows the groups\nwith and without post-COVID-19, and the groups with the three most prevalent\nspecific symptoms of post COVID-19 (altered smell or taste, dyspnea, and\nfatigue). All groups are compared to the group with no post COVID-19. All\nexposures are assessed at the 24-year follow-up in 2016–2019.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2/figures/3]\n\nParticipants with post COVID-19 dyspnea also had a higher prevalence of asthma\nand rhinitis before the pandemic (Fig. 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Fig3]B), and a higher\nprevalence of overweight, although not significant (Fig. 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Fig3]C). Migraine was more\ncommon among participants with post COVID-19, significant in the group with\naltered taste and smell, while the prevalence of ADHD/ADD, chronic bronchitis\nand depression before the pandemic did not differ significantly (Fig. 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Fig3]C). No difference in\nlung function (neither spirometry before or after bronchodilation nor lung\nclearance index (LCI) before the pandemic was observed in relation to post\nCOVID-19 (Supplementary Table S5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#MOESM1] and S6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#MOESM1] online).\n\n\nADJUSTED ASSOCIATION ANALYSES OF POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS FOR POST COVID-19\n\nIn a mutually adjusted multivariable logistic regression analysis among\nparticipants with confirmed COVID-19 (n = 510), no significant associations were\nobserved between sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors or chronic diseases\nand post COVID-19 (Table 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Tab3]). As observed in the\ndescriptive analyses, being bedbound during COVID-19 for one week or more was\nrelated to an increased risk for post COVID-19, however the confidence interval\nwas broad, and the association did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.69,\n95% CI 0.81, 3.56).Similar results were observed when investigating post\nCOVID-19 defined as symptoms lasting for at least 3 months after COVID-19\n(Supplementary Table S7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#MOESM1]).\n\nTable 3 Association between sociodemographic factors during the pandemic as well\nas chronic diseases before the pandemic and post COVID-19 among participants\nwith confirmed COVID-19, analyzed by a mutually adjusted multivariable logistic\nregression analysis (n = 510).\n\nFull size table [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2/tables/3]\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn the present study based on data from a population-based cohort with young\nadults, we observed that post COVID-19 symptoms for two months or more were\npresent among 16.5% of the participants with confirmed COVID-19. However, few of\nthese had been seeking healthcare for post COVID-19 symptoms or received a\ndiagnosis of post COVID-19. The most common symptom was an altered smell and\ntaste, present in more than two thirds of those with post COVID-19, followed by\ndyspnea and fatigue. Compared to participants without post COVID-19, those with\npost COVID-19, especially post COVID-19 dyspnea and fatigue had more often been\nbedbound during the COVID-19 infection. We found no difference in the prevalence\nof post COVID-19 between the sexes and observed no major differences in\nlifestyle factors or chronic diseases linked to post COVID-19. However, having\nasthma and/or rhinitis before the pandemic were associated with post COVID-19\ndyspnea, migraine with altered smell/taste, and lower self-rated health with\nfatigue.\n\nThe observed prevalence of post COVID-19 is lower than most previous studies7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR7],17\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR17],22\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR22],23\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR23], although\nrelatively similar to other population-based studies15\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR15],26\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR26],27\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR27]. For example, data\nfrom the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated\nthat 19% of those reported having COVID-19 in the past still had symptoms of\nlong COVID at the time of the survey26\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR26]. Another large\ncross-sectional study among US adults observed that 15% of the individuals with\na positive COVID-19 test reported continued symptoms for more than 2 months\nafter the acute illness15\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR15]. However, a pooled\nanalysis based on 54 studies and two medical record databases in the United\nStates found a lower prevalence; 6.2% of the individuals with symptomatic\nSARS-CoV-2 infections developed at least one of three self-reported long COVID\nsymptom clusters three months after symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR6]. In our BAMSE\ncohort, we have previously investigated self-reported long-term symptoms of\nsuspected COVID-19 during the first half year of the of the pandemic (February\nto August 2020)16 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR16].\nThis study showed that 11% of the participants with suspected COVID-19 symptoms\nhad long-term symptoms for at least 4 weeks. However, in the beginning of the\npandemic, testing for COVID-19 was not yet available for the general public in\nSweden, and therefore, we were not able to investigate confirmed disease at this\npoint.\n\nPrevious studies have identified older age as a risk factor for post COVID-194\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR4],13\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR13], however28\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR28], few studies have\nfocused specifically on young adults. In children, the prevalence of post COVID\nhas been shown to be lower compared to adults, however a substantial number of\nchildren have been reported to be affected6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR6],29\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR29]. As in adults, a\nwide range of long-term symptoms have been reported in children, although with a\nhigher prevalence of mental health problems28\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR28],29\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR29].\n\nIn contrast to most previous studies in adults9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR9], we did not observe\na significant over representation of females with post COVID-19, although there\nwas a slightly higher prevalence among the females. The sex distribution of post\nCOVID-19 has been found to differ depending on age with women more commonly\naffected in adulthood and up to approximately 60 years of age30\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR30], whereas men are\nover-represented in the older age groups4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR4].\n\nAfter a severe COVID-19 disease, breathing difficulties has been shown to be the\nmost common post COVID-19 symptom21\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR21], while a disease\ntreated in primary care was more often associated with tiredness/fatigue22\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR22],23\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR23],24\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR24]. The most common\npost COVID-19 symptom in our cohort was altered taste and smell, present in 69%\nof the participants with post COVID-19 (11.3% of the participants with confirmed\nCOVID-19). This is a higher prevalence than in most outpatient populations\ninvestigated4 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR4],22\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR22],23\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR23],31\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR31], although a\nprevalent symptom in the acute phase of the disease32\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR32],33\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR33]. In some studies,\nolfactory dysfunction has been linked to mild COVID-1934\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR34], a finding in line\nwith our results where dyspnea and fatigue, but not altered taste/smell, was\nlinked to disease severity (being bedbound). In a recent large Norwegian cohort\nstudy including participants aged 35–65 years, altered smell and taste was found\nto be the most specific symptom for post COVID-19. The other symptoms could be\ngrouped in two clusters, one with symptoms such as fatigue and poor memory, and\none related to respiratory symptoms like dyspnea and cough, suggesting different\naetiologies35 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR35].\nThis study also found more severe disease to be associated to a higher risk for\npost COVID-19 symptoms in the two clusters mentioned35\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR35]. Together with\nprevious studies, our results support an association between disease severity\nand spectrum of post COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nIn the present study, several potential risk factors for post COVID-19 were\ninvestigated. We did not find early life factors including infections or\nrespiratory symptoms to be associated with post COVID-19. Among the conditions\nreported at 24 years of age, there were no significant associations between\nlifestyle (tobacco use) or chronic conditions/diseases and post COVID-19,\nalthough both rhinitis and asthma were associated with post COVID-19 dyspnea.\nHowever, no association was found between lung function at 24 years of age and\npost COVID-19, neither spirometric nor measured with MBWO. COVID-19 in turn has\nnot been shown to affect spirometric lung function in young adults with mild\ndisease36 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR36]. This,\nhowever, does not rule out other conditions in the lung, such as a decreased\ndiffusion capacity, found to be a sequela often proportionate to disease\nseverity COVID-1937\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR37],38\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR38].\n\nOverweight was not related to post COVID-19 but was more common among those with\npost COVID-19 dyspnea (although the difference was not significant). These\nresults are in line with the previously established link between overweight and\nan altered ventilation pattern as well as chronic inflammation and asthma39\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR39]. In addition, we\nhave previously reported an association between asthma and higher levels of\nconcern of the own health and stress associated to COVID-1940\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR40], in all,\nsuggesting the dyspnea in the post COVID-19 context to be a multifactorial\ncondition.\n\nPrevious studies have observed that co-morbidities increase the risk for post\nCOVID-1938 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR38]. In the\npresent study, we did not find doctors diagnosed depression, ADHD or ADD, to\nhave any significant association to post COVID-19, although doctors diagnosed\nmigraine was more common among the participants with altered taste or smell.\nHowever, the lower level of participants who reported to be “completely healthy”\nat 24 years of age may suggest that those with post COVID-19 symptoms have an\nincreased susceptibility or other pre-existing diseases that were not assessed\nin this study.\n\nA limitation with our study is that some of the confirmed COVID-19 cases were\nself-reported (based on positive PCR, antigen, or antibody test taken before\nvaccination). The antigen tests have been shown to be less accurate compared to\nPCR-tests, although with a relatively high positive predictive value (true\npositive)41 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR41]. Also,\nnot all participants may have been tested for COVID-19, especially those with\nmild disease, which may lead to an incorrect estimate of the true proportion of\npost COVID-19. A general limitation in investigation of post COVID-19 is the\nunspecific character of the symptoms, which may be attributed to conditions\nother than COVID-1942\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR42]. As in all\nquestionnaire-based studies, there is also a risk of recall bias when reporting\nprevious symptoms. In addition, there was no question on whether the\nparticipants still had symptoms at the time of answering the questionnaire and\ntherefore no possibility to investigate how many that eventually recovered from\ntheir post COVID. It is also shown that post COVID symptoms differs by viral\nvariant15 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR15],43\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR43], and the results\nmay therefore not be representative of current viral variants. Unfortunately,\nthere was no available information about which viral variant the participants\nwere infected with, and this could therefore not be investigated further. With\nregards to the time point of data collection, this study likely mostly included\nwild-type SARS-CoV-2 (for cases during 2020), the alpha-variant (dominated in\nSweden in the first half of 2021) and the delta variant (dominated in Sweden in\nthe second half of 2021)44\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR44].\n\nThe main strength of the study is the population-based design with a\nwell-characterized study-population. Information on lifestyle factors and\nchronic diseases had been collected recently before the pandemic, as well as in\nearly life. Another strength is the high response rate limiting the risk of\nselection bias, although this cannot be ruled out since participants with post\nCOVID-19 symptoms may be more prone to participate in a COVID-19 directed\nfollow-up. At the same time, it is also possible that the most severe cases to a\nlower extent answered the questionnaire, which may have led to an\nunderestimation of severe post COVID.\n\nIn conclusion, post COVID-19 symptoms are common, also among young adults in the\ngeneral population. We identified no major risk factors including lifestyle and\nchronic diseases present before the pandemic for being affected, suggesting\nother factors and mechanisms to be involved (including genetics and immune\nresponse)45 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR45].\nAlthough not life threatening, post COVID-19 could have a considerable impact on\npublic health due to the high prevalence and long-term symptoms.\n\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe included population came from the population-based birth cohort BAMSE\n(Swedish: Barn, Allergi, Miljö, Stockholm, Epidemiologi). The cohort was\ninitiated 1994–1996 including originally 4089 children born in pre-selected\nareas of Stockholm County and have been followed by repeated questionnaires and\nexaminations to approximately 26 years of age so far. The participants parents\nresponded to questionnaires regarding early exposures at inclusion at 2–3 months\nand 1 and 2 years of age46\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR46]. At 22–24 years of\nage (2016–2019), the participants were followed-up with questionnaires and a\nphysical examination. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, further\ninvestigations have been done in three phases including repeated\nweb-questionnaires on COVID-19 symptoms, blood sampling and a clinical\ninvestigation47 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR47].\nFor this investigation questionnaire data from the third phase conducted between\nOctober 2021 and February 2022 was used. Invitation to the third phase was sent\nto all participants who had participated in the questionnaire at the 22–24 years\nfollow up and had provided their e-mail address (n = 2981). In total, 2049\n(68.7%) participated by answering a web-based questionnaire including questions\non post COVID-19 symptoms, lifestyle, and health during the whole pandemic (from\nFebruary 2020 up to the date of the questionnaire) (Fig. 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Fig4]). Due to missing data\non confirmed COVID-19 disease and/or post COVID-19 symptoms, the final study\npopulation consisted of 2022 participants (Fig. 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#Fig4]). The BAMSE-study is\napproved by the Ethical Review Board at Karolinska Institute Dnr: 93:189; Dnr:\n2016/1380-31/2; Dnr: 2016/2475-32; Dnr: 2020-02922. Written informed consent was\nobtained from all participants and/or their legal guardians. All research was\nperformed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nFigure 4\nfigure 4\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-023-38315-2/MediaObjects/41598_2023_38315_Fig4_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2/figures/4\n\nFlow chart of the included study population.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2/figures/4]\n\n\nDEFINITION OF COVID-19\n\nConfirmed COVID-19 was defined as any of: self-reported SARS-CoV-2 positive\nPCR-test, antigen test or IgG test (IgG taken before vaccination) and/or\npositive PCR-test in the database SmiNet (a national register for notifiable\ntransmittable diseases in Sweden, covering all positive PCR-tests)25\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR25],48\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR48]. up to the date of\nthe questionnaire. Being bedbound during the disease was used as a proxy for\ndisease severity.\n\n\nDEFINITION OF POST COVID-19 AND POST COVID-19 SYMPTOMS\n\nParticipants with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were asked about long-term\nsymptoms after the COVID-19 infection “Have you had long term symptoms after the\nCOVID-19 infection (post COVID/long COVID)?” Participants who answered “Yes” to\nthis question were asked about which long-term symptoms they have had and\nwhether the duration of each symptom was two months or more or three months or\nmore. The included long-term symptoms were: dyspnea (breathing difficulties or\nshortness of breath); fatigue (extreme physical and/or mental tiredness); fever\n(or feeling feverish); altered smell or taste; headache; tachycardia (high\nresting heart rate or palpitations); cognitive impairment (e.g., memory and\nconcentration difficulties); gastrointestinal problems; muscle weakness;\nneurological symptoms (e.g. numbness); psychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression,\nanxiety or feeling down); pain (e.g., chest pain or muscle and joint pain) and\nsleep disorders.\n\nPost COVID-19 was defined as at least one symptom lasting for at least 2 months\nafter COVID-19 in combination with confirmed COVID-19.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF RISK FACTORS AND BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS\n\nInformation on occupation, disease severity during COVID-19 and vaccination\nstatus was collected from the phase three COVID-19 follow up. In Sweden,\nvaccination against COVID-19 was offered to young adults around the summer of\n2021, with some variations depending on county. Pre-existing risk factors were\ncollected from the 24-year follow up and early exposures from the baseline\nquestionnaire, 1- and 2-years questionnaires.\n\nEarly factors investigated were maternal smoking during pregnancy and/or\ninfancy, pneumonia, wheeze and bronchitis up to 2 years of age. At the follow-up\nat 24 years of age the following exposures were evaluated in association to post\nCOVID-19: smoking and snuff use, overweight, asthma, allergic sensitization,\nrhinitis, and self-reported doctors diagnosed (ever) migraine, ADHD or ADD,\ndepression and self-reported health.\n\nAt the 24-year follow-up lung function testing was done with spirometry before\nand after bronchodilation, and multiple breath nitrogen wash out test (MBWO),\naccording to the ATS/ERS guidelines49\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR49],50\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#ref-CR50]. The details and\ndefinitions of the included variables are described in the Online Supplement\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38315-2#MOESM1].\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES AND STUDY DESIGN\n\nThe study population was characterized regarding sociodemographic factors and\nbackground factors, and differences between the groups (e.g., with and without\nconfirmed COVID-19) were tested by Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test. The\nprevalence of post COVID-19 was calculated among those with confirmed COVID-19\nand stratified by sex. The prevalence of specific post COVID-19 symptoms was\npresented among those with post COVID-19 and among all participants with\nconfirmed COVID-19.\n\nPotential risk factors for post COVID-19 were investigated by comparing\nsociodemographic factors, early exposures, lifestyle factors and chronic\ndiseases/conditions at the 24-year follow-up between participants with and\nwithout post COVID-19 (among those with confirmed COVID-19). The three most\ncommon post COVID-19 symptoms were thereafter analysed separately in a similar\nway. Lung function was compared between the post COVID-19 and no post COVID-19\ngroups as a continuous variable with two-tailed t-tests. Associations between\nsociodemographic- and lifestyle factors as well as chronic diseases before the\npandemic and post COVID-19 were further analyzed by a mutually adjusted\nmultivariable logistic regression analysis in a complete case analysis. The\nincluded variables were selected based on previously identified risk factors for\npost COVID-19 as well as from the descriptive analyses. As a sensitivity\nanalysis, post COVID-19 was also defined as symptoms lasting for at least\n3 months after COVID-19 in combination with confirmed COVID-19.\n\nThe analyses were done in STATA, Statistical Software release 16.0 (College\nStation, TX, USA), and diagrams/Figures in GraphPad Prism 9.3.0 (San Diego, CA,\nUSA). Inkscape 0.92 (http://www.inkscape.org [http://www.inkscape.org/]) and\nMicrosoft Power Point (version 2203), were used for creating Figures. A 2-sided\np-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY\n\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly\navailable due to the dataset containing sensitive personal data but are\navailable from the corresponding author on reasonable request and with\npermission from Karolinska Institutet.\n\n\nCODE AVAILABILITY\n\nThe computer code used to generate the results can be made available upon\nrequest.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n 1.

Fox Talks The Interrogation Room, Iconic Roles, & Where She'd Hide A\nBody\n\n * Off\n * English\n\nFor those who don’t know, melanoma is a type of skin cancer\n[https://www.theroot.com/kelis-explains-how-husband-mike-moras-death-impacted-he-1850243478].\nAlthough it’s less common than other types of skin cancers, it’s also more\naggressive.\n\nThe recent study tracked over 200,000 cases of male patients diagnosed with\ncutaneous invasive melanoma from 2004 to 2018. Although white men are more\nlikely to be diagnosed with melanoma, the study found that the five-year\nsurvival rate for Black men hovered at 51.7 percent, which was lower than any\nother racial group. On the flip side, the survival rate for white men was around\n75.1 percent.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that, in general, men have a higher rate of death\nfrom melanoma. The reasons for these disparities are debated\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/04/16/skin-cancer-men-melanoma-prevention/].\nSome experts suggest it has something to do with estrogen or other hormonal\nvariables. Another potential explanation is that studies have shown that men\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/04/16/skin-cancer-men-melanoma-prevention/]\nare less likely to use sunscreen than women. Men are also less likely to seek\nmedical care.\n\nThe underlying reasons for the racial disparities in mortality are also still an\nopen question. Access to health care could be a factor here. The study found\nthat Black men were likely to have private insurance. Skin color could be\nanother factor. Dermatologists and other medical professionals often have a\nharder time diagnosing melanoma in people with darker skin tones\n[https://www.aamc.org/news/why-are-so-many-black-patients-dying-skin-cancer#:~:text=It%20is%20not%20only%20melanoma,skin%2C%20according%20to%20Krueger's%20research%20.].\nThat means Black patients may struggle to get early diagnoses that could save\ntheir lives.\n\nWe still don’t have a firm grasp on why Black men are more likely to die from\nmelanoma. But increased research on this issue is undoubtedly an essential first\nstep."

        "content": "A bacterium that causes a disease called scrub typhus – a disease not previously\nreported in the United States – has been detected in North Carolina, according\nto a new study by researchers at North Carolina State University and\nUNC-Greensboro.\n\nThe researchers stress that scrub typhus, which can cause fever, headache and\nbody aches – and can be fatal if left untreated by antibiotics – has not yet\nbeen detected in animals or people in the state.\n\nThe NC State researchers detected the bacterium – the genus is Orientia in the\nfamily Rickettsiaceae – at a high frequency while testing free living, larval\n(ready to bite) trombiculid mites, commonly called chiggers, in several\ndifferent recreational parks in North Carolina.\n\n“We wanted to see if chiggers in the United States carried Orientia,” said\nLoganathan Ponnusamy, an NC State principal research scholar in entomology and\nco-corresponding author of a paper that describes the research. “We haven’t in\nthe past had the diagnostic tools to test for this specific bacterium at the\ngenus level.\n\n“We set a black tile on the ground in 10 different North Carolina state parks\nand picked up chiggers as they crossed the tile. Microbiome studies allowed us\nto characterize all the bacteria in the chiggers. One park showed a 90%\npositivity rate for the bacterium (nine out of 10 chiggers captured); another\nshowed an 80% positivity rate (eight of 10 chiggers captured). Other parks\nshowed positivity rates of just 10%.”\n\nTrombiculid mites are only parasitic in their larval stage. They search for\nvertebrate hosts – including humans – to bite, Ponnusamy says.\n\n“Chiggers can spread bacteria to people or rodents when they bite but can also\npass bacteria to future generations of mites through their eggs,” he added.\n\nThe researchers say that scrub typhus presents symptoms similar to those of\nRocky Mountain spotted fever, a disease generally ascribed to tick bites.\n\nScrub typhus is found more commonly in Asia and the Pacific, but in recent years\nhas been detected in Africa and the Middle East. It is uncertain whether spread\nis caused by people or goods carrying chiggers from one place to another.\n\n“We don’t know if this is a recent introduction into the state or if the\nbacterium has been here for years,” said R. Michael Roe, William Neal Reynolds\nDistinguished Professor of Entomology at NC State and co-author of the paper.\n“We also don’t know if the infected chiggers found in North Carolina actually\nwill cause disease; this has to be determined in future work.”\n\n“We also don’t have information about whether the chigger infection rate is\ndecreasing or increasing,” said Kaiying Chen, a postdoctoral research scholar at\nNC State and lead author of the paper.\n\nThe NC State and UNC-Greensboro researchers are resampling chiggers in the\nrecreational park sites to see if the reported findings remain consistent.\n\nThe paper appears in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases\n[https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/8/23-0528_article].

About 21 days earlier, he had\nfinished a course of antibiotics to treat a gum infection. Soon after the tongue\nbecame discolored, he was prescribed antifungals under the suspicion that he had\ncontracted oral candidiasis, a type of yeast infection, but to no avail. The\ndoctors then diagnosed the man with a clear-cut case of hairy tongue.\n\n\nHairy tongue [https://www.aaom.com/hairy-tongue] is caused by the build-up and\nlengthening of the tiny projections on our tongue called papillae (there are\ndifferent types of papillae, some of which contain our taste buds). Though it’s\nnot really hair that grows on the tongue, this accumulation is made of keratin,\nthe same major material found in hair. The discoloration of the tongue can be\naffected by the things our mouths are exposed to, such as certain foods or\ntobacco, or by the microbes growing on top of it. In some cases, for instance,\nthe condition can cause a build-up of microbes that then start to produce\npigments.\n\nMost reported cases of hairy tongue tend to be brown or black in appearance, so\nthe man’s green tongue was unusual. But he did have several known risk factors\nfor the condition, such as being older, recently using antimicrobials, and being\na smoker. He had no other possibly related or more serious symptoms, though,\nsuch as a loss of taste or nearby pain. And hairy tongue in general isn’t a big\ndeal and can be treated relatively easily.\n\nIn this case, the doctors advised him to gently scrub his tongue with a\ntoothbrush four times a day and to consider quitting smoking. Though he remained\na smoker at his follow-up visit six months later, his tongue was no longer\ngreen, the authors wrote."

        "content": "Head shot of child with medical face mask getting Intranasal Coronavirus\ncovid-19 vaccination ... [+] through nostril from doctor - concept of covid\nnasal vaccine.\n\ngetty\n\nA new nasally administered Covid-19 vaccine shows greater promise in protecting\npatients from both Omicron infection and disease progression than traditional\nvaccines used throughout the pandemic. A defining feature of the Covid pandemic\nis the ongoing mutation of the virus to avoid our medical interventions. We may\ndevelop a drug or vaccine that neutralizes X version of the virus, but then it\nmutates to Y version and escapes neutralization.\n\nThis is precisely what happened with the mRNA vaccines widely used in the United\nStates and elsewhere. When the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were first released\nin spring and summer 2021, they boasted roughly 90% protection against\nprogression to severe disease. However, this protection waned heavily over the\nfollowing months, both due to the nature of mRNA vaccines requiring multiple\nfollow-up doses, and the mutation of Covid-19 to more immune evasive variants.\n\nThe release of the bivalent booster in 2022 aided this regression, but only\nmoderately. Omicron and its subsequent family of variants remain highly immune\nevasive thanks in part to dozens of mutations littered throughout the genome,\nboth within and external to the well-documented spike protein.\n\nOne method of vaccine that has never been explored, however, was nasally\nadministered mucosal respiratory vaccines. Omicron, especially later variants\nsuch as BA.4 and BA.5, is known to have higher concentrations of the virus in\nthe lungs, meaning that a nasal vaccine could yield stronger protection.\n\nIn a study published last month in the Lancet, Prof Jing-Xin Li, Ph.D., from the\nNational Health Commission Key Laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology in\nChina, and coauthors investigated\n[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00350-X/fulltext#%20]\nthe world’s first licensed nasal vaccine, Ad5-nCoV, on a field of over 10,000\npatients. Here we analyze their findings and discuss the potential impact of the\nnasal vaccine on the future of the pandemic.\n\nThe Chinese Ad5-nCoV nasal vaccine acts as a booster dose similar to the\nbivalent mRNA booster in the United States. In China, a majority of citizens\nreceived two doses of inactivated virus vaccine, a common method of vaccination\nfor other pathogens, though not as effective for Covid-19 as the mRNA vaccines.\n\nOver a two-month span in 2022, over 10,000 patients received the nasal booster.\nOf these, 210 were monitored for immunogenicity follow-ups as compared to 210\nwho received a control of inactivated virus booster.\n\nThe researchers first note a clear negative about their vaccine. Adverse\nreactions to the nasal vaccine were increased (13%) as compared to the\ninactivated vaccine control group (7%). These reactions range from mild, such as\nsore throat, coughing, sneezing and headache, to much less common (fewer than\n1%) moderate symptoms, such as muscular weakness and myelopathy, or\ncompression-related spinal injury. This is to be expected with a vaccine taken\nthrough the respiratory tract as compared to intravenously.\n\nHowever, the vaccine posted much-improved numbers against Omicron. Four weeks\nafter a nasal vaccine dose, the anti-BA.4/5 neutralizing antibodies were\ndetected in 65% of participants in the immunogenicity subgroup, as compared to\nonly 2% of those in the controlled inactivated vaccine group. Not only were\nanti-Omicron antibodies found in more nasal vaccine patients, the average\nantibody titer count in the nasal vaccine group was over six-fold higher than\nthe control.\n\nWhile antibody responses are much higher in the nasal vaccine group, this does\nnot mean that infections are completely prevented. Only 35.1% were protected\nfrom infection at their 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome of Covid\nvaccines is not to prevent infection, but to prevent progression to severe\ndisease. In this realm, the nasal vaccine is very successful, limiting infected\npatients to only mild symptoms 98.1% of the time.\n\nFurthermore, T cell responses in the nasal vaccine group were far higher than\nthe control, suggesting the new vaccine more strongly enables adaptive immune\nclearance of the virus post-infection.\n\nTaken together, the advantages of Ad5-nCoV far outweigh the drawbacks. A six\npercentage point increase in adverse reactions to the vaccine is significantly\nmore, though the vast majority of these reactions are relatively mild, most of\nwhich are as limited as a cough or sneeze.\n\nConsidering the 32-fold increase in patients with anti-BA.4/5 antibody responses\nand six-fold increase in average titer, the odd cough and sneeze seems a fair\ntrade.\n\nAs we have recommended throughout the pandemic, we should receive an additional\ndose of Covid-19 vaccine every three to six months, as the antibodies developed\nby the immune system post-vaccination wane rapidly.\n\nThe Ad5-nCoV nasal vaccine is an encouraging alternative to intramuscular\nvaccination, joining intradermal and inhaled administration, the latter of which\nmay expose the oral and tracheal mucosa to antibodies. The nasal vaccine could\naccomplish a similar feat, adding to its value as an alternative vaccine.\n\nWere Ad5-nCoV to become available to American citizens in the future,\nconsidering the available safety and efficacy data, we highly encourage the\nregular administration of the vaccine. We would also encourage stateside vaccine\ndevelopers to consider a similar approach to vaccine development, as nasal\nvaccines may be the next great tool to fight the ongoing evolution of\nSARS-CoV-2."

        "content": "MAIN\n\nThe heart is composed of distinct tissues that contain niches of specialized\ncell types conferring site-specific functionality. Single-cell RNA sequencing\n(scRNA-seq) and single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) offer a powerful,\nunbiased framework to characterize these cells2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR2],3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR3]. The addition of\nspatially resolved transcriptomics allows us to restore structural information\nlost in single-cell techniques and to gain insight into collective function4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR4],5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR5].\n\nThe cardiac conduction system (CCS), responsible for the regular and coordinated\nelectrical activation of the heart, contains structures including the sinoatrial\nand atrioventricular nodes (SAN and AVN, respectively), the atrioventricular\nbundle (AVB) and the His-Purkinje network, which are each home to cells with\ndistinct electrophysiological properties6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR6]. We combine\ntargeted dissection and histology to generate full-breadth transcriptomics\nprofiles of human CCS cells. Furthermore, we use spatial transcriptomics to map\nthese cells into their microanatomical locations and discover their\nniche-partner cells. Inspired by the broad receptor expression profile of\npacemaker cells (P cells), we extend the cell–cell interaction database\nCellPhoneDB7 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR7] with a\nnew neural–GPCR module. This module highlights synaptic connections, including\nnew insights into neighbouring glial cells and glutamatergic signalling\ncapability.\n\nOff-target activity of non-cardiac therapies on the heart and its conduction\nsystem is a major reason for drug development failure and withdrawal8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR8]. To help address\nthis challenge, we develop a pipeline, drug2cell, which integrates drug–target\ninteractions from the ChEMBL database with user-provided single-cell data to\ncomprehensively evaluate drug-target expression in single cells. Applying this\napproach to P cells provides mechanistic insight into the chronotropic effects\nof non-cardiac medications.\n\nFinally, we show that our integrated multiomics approach is capable of niche\n(that is, cellular tissue microenvironment) discovery. We define an epicardial\nimmune defence system and a ventricular myocardial-stress niche, and infer\nspecific intercellular signalling active within each cellular microenvironment.\nThese new cardiac cellular niches enable us to refine the cellular components\nthat underlie the microanatomy of the human heart.\n\n\nMULTIMODAL PROFILING OF THE HUMAN HEART\n\nWe integrated previously published scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq)\ndatasets2 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR2] with\nnewly generated multiome data (paired snRNA-seq and single nucleus assay for\ntransposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq)) and spatial\ntranscriptomics data (10x Genomics). We studied the following eight anatomical\nregions: the left and right ventricles (LV and RV, respectively), the left and\nright atria (LA and RA, respectively), the apex (AX), the interventricular\nseptum (SP), the SAN and the AVN (Fig. 1a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1]). In total, our data\nincluded samples from 25 donors ranging from 20 to 75 years old (Fig. 1a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1]). All tissue samples\nwere from transplant donors without a history of cardiac disease or arrhythmia\n(Supplementary Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM3]), and hearts\ncontributing to the SAN and AVN regions were from donors with normal conduction\nparameters confirmed by 12-lead electrocardiograms before donation\n(Supplementary Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM3]).\n\nFig. 1: Multimodal profiling of the adult human heart.\nfigure 1\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06311-1/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6311_Fig1_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1/figures/1\n\na, Left, overview of study design and analyses.

Illustrations in a\nwere created using BioRender (https://biorender.com [https://biorender.com/]).\nThe CellPhoneDB illustration is courtesy of the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1/figures/1]\n\nTo capture CCS tissues from the SAN and the AVN regions, we used a two-stage\ndissection protocol (Supplementary Fig. 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). The presence of\nCCS structures was confirmed by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology in\nadjacent sections from the same blocks (Fig. 1b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1]). The SAN forms a\ndiscrete subepicardial structure at the junction of the crista terminalis and\nthe RA posterior wall, with P cells smaller and rounder than neighbouring\ncardiomyocytes (CMs) and surrounded by fibroblasts (FBs) and dense extracellular\nmatrix (ECM) (Fig. 1b [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1]\nand Supplementary Fig. 1a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). For the AVN,\ntissue samples including the triangle of Koch and the basal septum were\ncollected (Fig. 1b [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1] and\nSupplementary Fig. 1b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). Subsequently,\nadjacent sections were taken for spatial transcriptomics analysis. The remaining\ntissue was sectioned and homogenized to generate nuclei suspensions for multiome\nanalysis.\n\nAfter sample processing and quality control, 704,296 cells and nuclei (of which\n211,060 nuclei were from newly generated multiome data) were retained for gene\nexpression, and 144,762 nuclei were retained for ATAC-seq analyses (Fig. 1a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1]). Integration of gene\nexpression data was performed and accounted for batch variations such as donor,\ncell or nuclei and the 10x Genomics chemistry version used (Supplementary Fig.\n2a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]) while retaining\nthe regional differences of the atrial (RA and LA), ventricular (RV, LV, SP and\nAX) and conduction system (SAN and AVN) samples (Supplementary Fig. 2b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). Leiden clustering\nwas performed on the neighbourhood graph created using batch-corrected latent\nvariables. The analyses identified 12 coarse-grained cell types annotated using\ncurated lineage-specific gene markers (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig6]).\n\nTo identify fine-grained cell states of the CCS, SAN region atrial CMs were\nsubclustered, which revealed a clearly separated cluster of P cells (SAN_P_cell)\nthat expressed canonical pacemaker-associated channel genes (HCN1, HCN4 and\nCACNA1D) and the transcription factor (TF) TBX3 (ref. 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR1]) (Fig. 1c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1] and Extended Data Fig.\n2a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). Subclustering of\nAVN atrial and ventricular CMs (aCMs and vCMs, respectively) showed two CCS\nclusters: P cells (AVN_P_cell) and AV bundle cells (AV_bundle_cell) (Fig. 1d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1] and Extended Data Fig.\n2b [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). AV bundle cells\nformed a distinct cluster defined by an enrichment of GJA5 (which encodes the\ngap junction protein Cx40), CRNDE and CNTN5, which were previously identified as\nmarkers of AV bundle cells in the mouse heart9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR9] (Fig. 1d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1] and Extended Data Fig.\n2c [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). Purkinje cells\n(originally termed fibres) are specialized CM-like cells that constitute the\ndistal ramifications of the ventricular conduction system. They play an\nimportant part in propagating impulses from the AV bundle branches and their\nfascicles to the ventricular muscle and are most abundant at the AX10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR10]. To identify this\nrare population at single-cell resolution, CMs from AVN samples were integrated\nand clustered with those from the AX. Cluster 8 (Extended Data Fig. 2d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]) contained CCS cells\nfrom the AVN and a population derived from the AX expressing Purkinje cell\nmarker genes (GJA5, IRX3, KCNJ3 and MYL4)9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR9] (Fig. 1e\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1] and Extended Data Fig.\n2d,e [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). All the\nidentified CCS cells were observed in multiple donors (Extended Data Fig. 2f\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]).\n\nTo confirm their identity, CCS cell states defined by sc/snRNA-seq data were\nmapped in spatial transcriptomics data using cell2location, a deconvolution\nmethod capable of resolving even rare cell populations11\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR11]. This analysis\nshowed each cell state localized to their expected histologically identified CCS\nstructures (Fig. 1f [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1]\nand Extended Data Fig. 2g\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]).\n\nOther cell states were defined using label transfer with a published dataset2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR2] as a reference.\nMinor revisions of annotation were included. Based on recent studies of the\nheart and the gut that defined cells expressing PLP1, NRXN1 and NRXN3 as glial\ncells12 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR12],13\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR13], we annotated\ncells expressing pan-glial gene markers and lacking core neuronal genes\n(Extended Data Fig. 2h,i\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]) as glia (labelled\nwith the ‘_glial’ suffix). FB4 was named as FB4_activated on the basis of\nincreased expression of TGFβ-responsive FB activation signature genes (POSTN,\nTNC, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1 and FN1), which includes genes encoding ECM\nproteins, compared with other FBs (Extended Data Fig. 2h,j\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). vCM3 was named\nvCM3_stressed on the basis of expression of CM stress markers (NPPB, LMCD1,\nXIRP2, ACTA1 and PFKP)3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR3],14\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR14] (Extended Data\nFig. 2h,k [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). Myeloid\ncell states were annotated as described in the Methods\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Sec14] (Supplementary Fig.\n2c,d [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). Collectively,\nwe defined 75 cell states (Extended Data Fig. 1a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig6]).\n\n\nCHROMATIN LANDSCAPE OF CARDIAC CELLS\n\nsnATAC-seq data were analysed to understand the chromatin landscape and the\ngenomic regulation of cardiac cell identity. Coarse-grained cell types were\nclearly separated in the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP),\nwhich indicated that each cardiac cell type has a distinct pattern of chromatin\naccessibility (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig6]). In the vCM\ncompartment, vCM3_stressed showed a clear separation in the UMAP (Extended Data\nFig. 1a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig6]), and regions\nassociated with its marker genes were differentially accessible compared with\nother CMs (Extended Data Fig. 2l\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). Differential\nchromatin accessibility analysis comparing CCS cells and other aCMs identified\nmajor markers for P cells such as genes encoding ion channel subunits (CACNA1D\nand CACNA2D2) and TFs (ISL1, TBX3 and SHOX2) (Extended Data Fig. 2m\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]).\n\nCommon variant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome-wide\nassociation studies (GWAS) are frequently located in noncoding regions15\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR15]. We used\nsnATAC-seq data to link cell types with cardiovascular traits by calculating the\nenrichment of GWAS trait-associated SNPs in their open chromatin regions\n(Extended Data Fig. 3a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig8]). Traits that reflect\nventricular physiology (for example, QRS duration, systolic function and QT\ninterval) showed an expected enrichment among vCMs but also in aCMs and CCS cell\nstates, in particular SAN P cells. This result underscored that fact that\nventricular function partly depends on atrial function. Conversely, traits that\nreflect pacemaker activity (RR interval, heart rate response to exercise and its\nrecovery) were limited to P cells and aCMs. For disease-associated SNPs, vCMs\nwere enriched for cardiomyopathy-associated SNPs as expected; however,\nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) SNPs were also enriched in aCMs (Extended Data\nFig. 3b [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig8]). This result\nsuggests that the frequent atrial involvement in HCM might also be due to a\nprimary atrial myopathy and is not merely a secondary phenomenon. The result is\nalso consistent with the finding of atrial dysfunction in patients with HCM\ncarrying pathogenic variants who have not developed ventricular hypertrophy.\nConversely, atrial fibrillation SNPs were significantly enriched in CCS cells,\naCM2 cells and vCM3_stressed clustered cells. The latter finding emphasizes the\ninterdependence of atrial and ventricular function and supports the strong\nepidemiological evidence that abnormal ventricular function may drive atrial\nfibrillation16 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR16].\n\n\nUNBIASED DISCOVERY OF CELLULAR NICHES\n\nTo understand the cellular composition of microanatomical structures, we mapped\nthe fine-grained cell states defined by sc/snRNA-seq analysis to spatial\ntranscriptomics data using cell2location11\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR11] (Fig. 2a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig2]). In parallel,\nhistological structural annotation based on H&E images was performed by an\nexpert (S.Y.H.). Mapping of expected cell types to the structures was confirmed\n(Supplementary Fig. 3a–d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). In the\nhistologically annotated node of SAN samples, we found enrichment of P cells and\nother cell states, such as FBs and glial cells expressing NGF (which encodes\nneuronal growth factor) (NC2_glial_NGF+) (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig9]). Similarly, the\nannotated node and AV bundle structures of AVN samples from multiple donors\nincluded FBs, NC2_glial_NGF+ and tissue-resident macrophages (MPs) (LYVE1+ MP)\ntogether with P cells or AV bundle cells, respectively (Extended Data Fig.\n4a,c–e [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig9]). In contrast\nto results reported for mouse AVN17\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR17], our data did not\nhighlight the expression of connexin 43 (encoded by GJA1) or other connexins in\nMPs and monocytes of the SAN and AVN (Extended Data Fig. 4f\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig9]). In the epicardium of\nall four cardiac chambers, we detected enrichment of expected cell states\n(mesothelial cells, FBs, lymphatic endothelial cells (EC8_ln) and adipocytes),\nbut also plasma B cells (B_plasma) and LYVE1+IGF1+ MPs (Extended Data Fig. 4g\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig9]).\n\nFig. 2: Identification of cellular niches in the adult human heart.\nfigure 2\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06311-1/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6311_Fig2_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1/figures/2\n\na, Overview of the spatial data analysis workflow. Visium spots were\nhistologically annotated. Cell states defined by sn/scRNA-seq analysis were\nmapped to Visium spots using cell2location. NMF was used to decompose manually\nannotated structures into factors. Spatially resolved analysis of cell–cell\ninteractions was performed using a custom neural–GPCR CellPhoneDB module. b–g,\nCellular microenvironment identification in the SAN (b–d) and the RV (e–g).\nHistological structures were manually annotated on the basis of H&E stainings\n(representative of four hearts) (b,e). Factor loadings (estimated abundance of\ncell state group) of factors identified using cell2location NMF analysis are\nshown in spatial coordinates (c,f). Dot plots illustrate cell states with more\nthan 0.4 normalized cell abundance (dot colour and size) in a factor (d,g).\nIllustrations in a were created using BioRender (https://biorender.com\n[https://biorender.com/]). The cell2location illustration is reproduced with\npermission from ref. 11\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR11], Springer Nature\nAmerica. The CellPhoneDB illustration is courtesy of the Wellcome Sanger\nInstitute.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1/figures/2]\n\nTo identify cellular niches in an unbiased manner and to decompose the\nH&E-discernible structures, we performed non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)\non the cell2location spot-by-cell output and defined factors of co-occurring\ncell states11 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR11]. We\nassessed the similarity between the NMF-identified factors and the manually\nannotated structures by calculating an effect size of the spot factor loadings\nin a given structure compared with other areas (Fig. 2a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig2] and Supplementary Fig.\n4 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). This analysis\nconfirmed that NMF analysis can define multiple distinct cellular niches within\nhistologically defined structures. For example, the node structure in SAN\nsections from three donors separated into central and peripheral regions (Fig.\n2b,c [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig2] and Extended Data\nFig. 5a(i),b(i–iii),c(i–iii)\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig10]). The central region\ncontained P cells, FB4_activated and NC2_glial_NGF+ cells, whereas the\nperipheral region was enriched for tissue-resident LYVE1+ MPs and other FBs,\nincluding the basal FB2 (Fig. 2d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig2] and Extended Data\nFigs. 5a(ii),b(iii,iv),c(iii,iv)\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig10] and  6a–d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig11]). These data clearly\nindicate that the human SAN is a compartmentalized structure that consists of a\ncentral region with the functionally important P cells embedded among activated\nFBs and glial cells, and surrounded by a peripheral region of immune and other\nFB populations. This two-layered structure of the SAN may contribute to\ninsulating the P cells to optimize the source–sink relationship and maintain\nsinus node function18\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR18]. In the node and\nbundle structures of the AVN region, we observed the enrichment of P cells and\nNC2_glial_NGF+ cells together with FBs and LYVE1+ MPs. However, unlike the SAN,\nthere was no compartmentalized cell arrangement, and FB4_activated cells were\nnot abundant (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig9]).\n\nSpatial transcriptomics data showed enrichment of genes that encode ECM proteins\nand metalloproteinases in the SAN (Extended Data Fig. 6e\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig11]). CellPhoneDB\nanalysis7 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR7] of the\ncells predicted TGFβ ligand–receptor interactions from cells expressing the\nligand genes TGFB1 (LYVE1+IGF+ MPs) and TGFB2 (SAN_P_cell and NC2_glial_NGF+) to\nFB4_activated cells expressing the receptor genes TGFBR1 and TGFBR3 (Extended\nData Fig. 6f [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig11]). This\nresult suggests that cells from both central and peripheral regions contribute\nto ECM formation.\n\nIn ventricular and atrial free walls, we assessed the similarities of\nNMF-identified factors compared with the manually annotated\nepicardium–subepicardium structure (comprising the epicardial mesothelium\nmonolayer and subepicardial fibrosis) (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig12]). This analysis\ndecomposed the epicardium–subepicardium structure into a distinct immune\nepicardium niche (enriched for lymphatic endothelial and immune cells) and a\nfibrotic epicardium niche (consisting of multiple FB cell states) (Fig. 2e,f\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig2] and Extended Data Fig.\n7c,d [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig12]). Plasma B cells\nwere present in both epicardial niches, although at a higher proportion in the\nimmune niche (Fig. 2g [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig2]\nand Extended Data Fig. 7d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig12]).\n\n\nION CHANNEL PROFILE OF CCS CELLS\n\nDifferential ion channel expression profiles (relative to non-CCS aCMs)\nhighlighted the electrophysiological specialization of the CCS cell states: SAN\nand AVN P cells, AV bundle cells and Purkinje cells (Fig 3a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3], Extended Data Fig. 8a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13] and Supplementary\nTable 2 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM4]). In\ncontrast to other CMs, the P cell action potential upstroke is mediated by\ncalcium rather than sodium influx6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR6]. Accordingly, both\nthe SAN and AVN P cells showed downregulation of the sodium channel gene SCN5A\nand upregulation of the L-type calcium channel gene CACNA1D (Fig. 3a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3]), the mutation of\nwhich causes sinoatrial node dysfunction and bradycardia19\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR19]. Two classical\nhyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) pacemaker channel\ngenes (HCN1 and HCN4) were enriched in P cells from both nodes (Fig. 3a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3], phase 4). CACNA1G,\nwhich encodes the T-type calcium channel α-subunit (CaV3.1) and is crucial in\npacemaking in rodents6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR6], was highly\nexpressed in SAN P cells only. Moreover, the expression of CACNA1G was lower\nthan for CACNA1D, which highlights the importance of the latter in human\npacemaking (Fig. 3a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3],\nphase 0). Several ion channels (CACNA1D, HCN1, KCNJ3, TRPM3 and CLIC5) seemed to\nhave cross-species importance because they were also upregulated in mouse SAN\nP cells (relative to working atrial myocytes) (Supplementary Fig. 5a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]).\n\nFig. 3: Human P cell profiles and nodal niche interactions.\nfigure 3\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06311-1/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6311_Fig3_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1/figures/3\n\na, Top, expression of genes encoding ion channel subunits in P cells. Triangles\nindicate differential expression.

Principal currents\nare depicted with corresponding channel subunit expressions. b, Schematic\nrepresentation of GPCRs and G protein signalling in CCS cells. Differentially\nexpressed genes (versus other aCMs) are in bold. Asterisks mark genes expressed\nin >10% of P cells that are not differentially expressed (Extended Data Fig.\n8e,f [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). c.

P cells interact with ECM proteins (secreted by\nFBs) and NC2_glia_NGF+ cells, forming synapse-like connections through\nneurexins. NC2_glia_NGF+ cells support glutamatergic signalling and release NGF,\nwhich interacts with receptors on autonomic neurons. P cells express receptors\nfor autonomic neurotransmitters, glutamate and angiotensin II (ATII), which is\nproduced locally by NC2_glial_NGF+ cells and FBs. h, Immunofluorescence staining\nof the SAN with anti-HCN1 (pink) and anti-PLP1 (yellow) antibodies and nuclei\n(DAPI, blue). Arrowheads indicate colocalization of HCN1 and PLP1. Images from\ntwo independent donors (AV14 and AH6) are shown. Illustrations in a,b,d,g were\ncreated using BioRender (https://biorender.com [https://biorender.com/]).\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1/figures/3]\n\nPotassium channel currents contribute to membrane repolarization, which in turn\nregulates the firing rate of P cells (Fig. 3a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3], phase 3). KCNJ5, a\nG protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel subunit was\nupregulated in both P cell types (Fig. 3a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3]). GIRK channels are\ndirectly activated by the βγ-subunit of various GPCRs to modulate cell\nexcitability6 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR6],\nwhich highlights the specialization of P cells to respond to physiological\nstimuli. Among other potassium channels, KCNN2 was highly expressed in both\nP cell types, whereas KCNK13 was specific to AVN P cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). The former is\nactivated by intracellular calcium whereas the latter is activated by a range of\nstimuli, including arachidonic acid and purine receptor agonism6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR6].\n\nVarious ion channel genes not traditionally associated with cardiac pacemaking\nwere highly expressed in P cells, including several members of the transient\nreceptor potential (TRP) family of nonselective cation channels (TRPC4, TRPM3,\nTRPM7, PKD2, MCOLN2 and MCOLN3). Notably, TRPM3 was strongly expressed in SAN\nP cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). ANO6, which encodes\na calcium-activated chloride channel, was upregulated in SAN and AVN P cells and\nin AV bundle cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). The role of these\nion channels in CCS cell function requires further investigation.\n\nAlthough there were similarities in the ion channel expression profiles of AV\nbundle cells and P cells (CACNA1D, KCNN2, ANO6 and GRIA3), bundle cells were\nmarked by the expression of the high-conductance gap junction subunit Cx40\n(Extended Data Fig. 8b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). KCND2, a gene\nassociated with nocturnal atrial fibrillation20\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR20] and Brugada\nsyndrome, was also specifically expressed in AV bundle cells. Purkinje cells\nshowed a gene expression profile closest to vCMs (Extended Data Fig. 8c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). However, the GIRK\nchannel subunit KCNJ3 and two classically neuron-associated calcium channel\nsubunits (CACNA1E and CACNA1B) were more highly expressed in Purkinje cells than\nin vCMs (Extended Data Fig. 8d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). Consistent with a\nfast-conducting phenotype, AV bundle and Purkinje cells were enriched for GJA5\nexpression, whereas P cells expressed the ultra-low conductance gap junction\nsubunit GJC1 (which encodes Cx45)6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR6] (Extended Data Fig.\n8c [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]).\n\nAltogether, these data provide a highly specific map of genes and cells of the\nconduction system and may guide future functional studies defining cell-specific\ndruggable targets.\n\n\nGPCR PROFILE OF CCS CELLS\n\nHeart rate is tightly regulated by various neurohumoral factors, primarily\nthrough GPCR signalling21\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR21]. CCS cells\nexhibited a wide range of GPCRs, G protein subunits and second-messenger\nmachinery (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). Within the group of\nreceptors were the classical acetylcholine muscarinic (M2) (encoded by CHRM2)\nand catecholamine β (encoded by ADRB1) receptors, which are responsible for\nmediating the major heart-rate-modulating effects of the autonomic nervous\nsystem (ANS)22 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR22]. In\naddition, we found receptors for several neurohumoral ligands in P cells,\nincluding angiotensin II (encoded by AGTR1), calcitonin gene-related peptide\n(encoded by CALCRL), glucagon-like peptide 1 (encoded by GLP1R), parathyroid\nhormone (encoded by PTH1R) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (encoded by VIPR2).\nThe adhesion GPCR family, which are activated by the binding of their\nextracellular domain to ligands on neighbouring cells or within the ECM and\nare involved in neuronal cell migration and synaptogenesis23\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR23], were highly\nrepresented within CCS cells (ADGRL3, ADGRG6 and CELSR1) (Fig. 3b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3], Extended Data Fig. 8e\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]).\n\nTo enable a comprehensive analysis of GPCR interactions in the node, we\nsupplemented the CellPhoneDB database7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR7] with a custom\nmodule of GPCR and trans-synaptic adhesion molecule interactions, adding more\nthan 1,000 new ligand–receptor pairs (Supplementary Tables 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM5] and 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM6]). Spatially resolved\nCellPhoneDB analysis showed multiple interactions through adhesion GPCRs\nexpressed in SAN P cells. ECM proteins, including laminin (encoded by LAMA2)\nexpressed in NC2_glial_NGF+ cells and FBs interacted with the receptor encoded\nby ADGRG6 in SAN P cells (Extended Data Fig. 8g\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). Interaction of\nangiotensinogen (encoded by AGT), the precursor peptide for the ligand\nangiotensin II, and its receptor encoded by AGTR1 was predicted in the nodes of\nboth the SAN and the AVN (Extended Data Fig. 8g,h\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). Spatial\ntranscriptomics data confirmed AGT expression in the manually annotated node\nstructure (Supplementary Fig. 5b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). This result is\nconsistent with the identification of local renin–angiotensin circuits and a\nprevious study24 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR24]\nshowing enriched angiotensinogen expression in the human CCS. These GPCR\nrepertoires support CCS cell responsiveness to an array of neurohumoral factors\nand interactivity with ECM components and cells in their niche.\n\n\nGENE REGULATORY NETWORKS IN P CELLS\n\nTo reveal gene regulatory networks that influence P cell gene expression\nprofiles, we constructed both activator and repressor networks using multiome\ndata (Fig. 3c [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3],\nExtended Data Fig. 8i\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13], Supplementary Fig.\n5c,d [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1] and\nSupplementary Tables 5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM7] and 6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM8]). TF and target gene\ninteractions inferred from the snATAC-seq data analysis largely overlapped with\nthe network predicted by gene expression.\n\nNotably, our results indicated that FOXP2, a TF associated with language centre\ndevelopment in the brain, is a key TF targeting major P cell ion channel genes\nsuch as HCN1 and CACNA1D, as well as TBX3 (a repressor of working myocyte gene\nprogrammes1 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR1]) (Fig.\n3c [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3] and Supplementary\nTable 5 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM7]). The FOXP2\nand HCN1 interaction was also observed in the snATAC-seq analysis (Extended Data\nFig. 8j [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). This result\nmay explain why mice carrying one non-functional Foxp2 allele have lower pulse\nrates than wild-type littermates25\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR25]. PRDM6, which is\nassociated with heart rate recovery during exercise26\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR26], regulated\nmultiple genes encoding ion channels and GPCR. CREB5, which encodes\ncAMP-responsive element-binding protein 5 and is associated with atrial\nfibrillation27 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR27],\nwas also one of the TFs highly expressed in P cells compared with other aCMs.\n\nIn the repressor network, TBX3 was highlighted as a regulator of genes encoding\nGPCRs and proteins involved in electrophysiological processes, such as SCN5A and\nGJA1, and NPPA (Extended Data Fig. 8i\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13] and Supplementary\nTable 6 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM8]). This\nresult is consistent with a TBX3-dependent mechanism that suppresses the working\nmyocyte programme in P cells1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR1]. TCF4, which is\nassociated with the capacity to increase heart rate during exercise28\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR28], showed repressive\ninteractions with multiple genes that encode sarcomeric proteins (MYOM1, MYOM2\nand MYL4) (Extended Data Fig. 8i\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]).\n\nThese predicted control mechanisms may be useful in the engineering of better\nmodels of human P cells in vitro.\n\n\nGLUTAMATERGIC SIGNALLING IN THE NODES\n\nIn the histological node structure of both the SAN and the AVN, we observed\nenrichment and colocalization of P cells with NC2_glial_NGF+ cells (Fig. 2d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig2] and Extended Data\nFigs. 4a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig9] and 5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig10]). This glial\npopulation expresses neurexins (NRXN1 and NRXN3), which form trans-synaptic\ncomplexes with cell adhesion molecules29\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR29]. Our neural–GPCR\nCellPhoneDB module highlighted several such interactions with P cells (NLGN1,\nADGRL1, ADGRL3, DAG1 and CLSTN1) (Fig. 3d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3] and Extended Data Fig.\n9a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig14]).\n\nWe also discovered that P cells and NC2_glial_NGF+ cells express genes involved\nin glutamatergic signalling. P cells expressed high levels of the glutamate\nreceptor GRIA3 (an AMPA-type receptor) and GRID2 (Extended Data Fig. 9b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig14]), which encodes a\npostsynaptic auxiliary subunit that forms a molecular bridge to the presynaptic\nmembrane30 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR30]. The\nglutamate transporter SLC1A3 and synthetic enzyme GLS, as well as synaptic\nvesicle genes such as SNAP25 and STX7, were expressed in both SAN and AVN\nP cells. Spatially resolved CellPhoneDB analysis of the central nodal niche in\nthe SAN or the node structure of the AVN highlighted P cell-to-P cell\nglutamatergic signalling through three ionotropic glutamate receptors (GRIA3,\nGRIK1 and GRIK2) in both the SAN and the AVN (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig14]). Expression of GRIA3\nis consistent with the recent observation in rodents of\ncardiomyocyte–cardiomyocyte glutamate signalling through Gria3 (ref. 31\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR31]). Opening of these\nionotropic channels increases cardiomyocyte excitability and may directly\naccelerate P cell firing. NC2_glial_NGF+ cells expressed genes involved in the\nglutamate–glutamine cycle, the means by which astroglia replenish glutamine\npools for neighbouring glutamatergic neurons32\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR32]. That is, the\nglutamate reuptake transporter EAAT2 (encoded by SLC1A2), glutamine synthetase\n(encoded by GLUL), which remakes glutamine from glutamate, and the glutamine\ntransporter (encoded by SLC38A9), which releases extracellular glutamine\n(Extended Data Fig. 9b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig14]). Conversely, P cells\nexpressed glutamine transporter (encoded by SLC38A1) and glutaminase (encoded by\nGLS), which converts glutamine to the active neurotransmitter glutamate. These\nfindings suggest that human P cells express the requisite machinery for\nglutamatergic signalling and that NC2_glial_NGF+ cells may form synapses with\nCCS cells and have an astrocyte-like support role.\n\n\nINNERVATION OF THE NODES\n\nThe majority of cardiac autonomic neurons reside in extracardiac structures (the\nparavertebral ganglia and brainstem). However, a number of neurons are native to\nthe heart, forming the intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS)22\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR22]. The ICNS neuronal\nbodies are concentrated within the subepicardial fat in structures known as\nganglionated plexi33\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR33]. Our snRNA-seq\ndata did not contain cells matching the profiles of autonomic neurons, probably\nbecause of the rarity of ICNS neurons. However, we identified the right atrial\nganglionated plexus (RAGP), which houses the somata of neurons innervating the\nSAN33 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR33], in six\nspatial transcriptomics sections across three donors (Fig. 3e\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3]). A score calculated\nfor the expression of pan-neuronal cytoskeletal markers (PRPH, NEFL, NEFM and\nNEFH) mapped to the Visium spots on the RAGP region (Fig. 3e\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3] and Extended Data Fig.\n9e [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig14]). Correlating the\nscore with gene expression for the corresponding Visium spots enabled us to\nreveal a transcriptome-wide profile of a human ganglionated plexi (Extended Data\nFig. 9f [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig14] and\nSupplementary Table 7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM9]). The neuropeptide\nsomatostatin (encoded by SST), previously identified as a marker of RAGP\nneuronal populations in pig33\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR33], was highly\ncorrelated with the pan-neuronal cytoskeletal score. Other significantly\ncorrelated genes were the cholinergic markers SLC18A3, SLC5A7, CHAT and ACHE,\nthe catecholamine synthetic enzymes TH and DDC and the sympathetic\nco-transmitter neuropeptide Y (encoded by NPY) (Fig. 3f\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3] and Extended Data Fig.\n9f,g [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig14]). The relevant\ncorresponding receptors (adrenergic and cholinergic) were also expressed in\nP cells. The expression of several markers typical of neuroendocrine cells, such\nas synaptophysin (encoded by SYP), secretogranin II (encoded by SCG2),\nchromogranin A (encoded by CHGA) and chromaffin granule amine transporter\n(encoded by SLC18A1), also correlated with the pan-neuronal cytoskeletal score\n(Supplementary Table 7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM9]).\n\nCardiac sympathetic neuron viability depends on a continuous source of the\nneurotrophin NGF, with recent work in rats suggesting that CMs are a source34\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR34]. However, in our\nhuman dataset, NGF was more highly expressed in NC2_glial_NGF+ cells than in CMs\nand other neural cells (Extended Data Fig. 2i\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). Furthermore, the\nexpression of NGF receptors p75NTR (encoded by NGFR) and TrkA (encoded by NTRK1)\ncorrelated with the pan-neuronal cytoskeletal markers (Fig. 3f\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3] and Extended Data Fig.\n9f [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig14]). In porcine RAGP,\nNTRK1 expression was found specifically in neurons with axonal projections to\nthe SAN33 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR33]. Thus,\nnodal NGF signalling from NC2_glial_NGF+ cells may promote and maintain\ninnervation from the nearby RAGP.\n\nOverall, we propose a nodal cellular circuit wherein NC2_glial_NGF+ cells play a\npivotal part. That is, they synaptically interact with P cells, facilitating\nglutamatergic signalling (which potentially modulates firing rate) and promoting\nautonomic innervation through NGF signalling (Fig. 3g\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3]). Immunofluorescence\nstaining of the node with antibodies targeting markers of glial cells (PLP1) and\nP cells (HCN1) confirmed the proximity of these two cell types in the node (Fig.\n3h [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3]). In particular,\nprocesses from PLP1-positive glial cells seemed to contact HCN1-positive\nP cells, thereby providing support for our proposed model.\n\n\nDRUG TARGETING AT SINGLE-CELL RESOLUTION\n\nThe cells of the CCS are important targets for chronotropic drugs. Therefore, we\nsought to leverage our human heart data to map drugs to target these cells.\nSeveral single-cell studies and methods have been published that use\ndrug-response transcriptional signatures obtained from cell line experiments and\ndata-mining35 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR35] to\npredict drug effects. However, these studies require the development of\ncell-type-specific in vitro models, which can fail to fully recapitulate the\nprofiles of their in vivo human counterparts. To comprehensively evaluate\ndrug-target expression using single-cell data, we developed a Python package,\ndrug2cell, which uses pairs of drugs and their target molecules from any drug or\ntarget database. In this instance, we used the ChEMBL database\n(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/]) (Fig. 4a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig4]). With this\nstreamlined workflow, we applied selected drug–target pairs to single-cell\ndatasets that can be filtered on the basis of quantitative bioactivity metrics,\ndrug categories and clinical trial phases, and target molecule classes. Once\ndrug scores were calculated, it was possible to achieve the following targets:\n(1) find cells that are targeted by drugs of interest; (2) find drugs that\ntarget cells of interest; and (3) find target molecules expressed in the target\ncells and potentially mediate the effect of the drug (Fig. 4a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig4]).\n\nFig. 4: Drug target exploration at the single-cell level.\nfigure 4\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06311-1/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6311_Fig4_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1/figures/4\n\na, Schematic of drug2cell analysis. Drugs and their target molecules from the\nChEMBL database were queried and filtered on the basis of bioactivity metrics,\nAnatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification, clinical trial phase and\nclasses of molecular targets. Single-cell gene expression data were used to\ncalculate scores and to predict drug interactions for a given cell state. Scores\nwere used to achieve the following aims: (1) find cells targeted by drugs of\ninterest; (2) find drugs targeting cells of interest; and (3) find target\nmolecules expressed in the target cells to infer the effect of a drug. b,\nHeatmap of drug scores that are significantly higher in P cells compared with\nother cell states (two-sided Wilcoxon test, log2(fold change) > 2,\nP value < 0.05, corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg method).

EC, endothelial cell. c, Schematic representation of\nputative cell targets for chronotropic drugs. Single-cell profiling revealed\nthat P cells express genes encoding targets of chronotropic drugs (yellow\ncircle), indicative of ANS-independent mechanisms, such as in the case of the\nGLP1 analogues and perampanel. β, β-adrenergic receptor; M2, muscarinic\nacetylcholine receptor M2. Illustrations in a,c were created using BioRender\n(https://biorender.com [https://biorender.com/]).\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1/figures/4]\n\nAs an example, we explored clinically approved drugs of all categories\n(Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification) registered in ChEMBL to\nidentify the drugs with the strongest predicted effect on P cells compared with\nother cardiac cell states (Fig. 4b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig4]). This analysis\nhighlighted the group of drugs belonging to the ‘Cardiovascular system’\ncategory, including ivabradine (a HCN1 and HCN4 inhibitor), quinidine (a class I\nantiarrhythmic agent) and atropine (an anticholinergic agent), which are\nclinically used drugs with chronotropic effects and are known to act on\nP cells36 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR36]. To\nfurther explore other groups of drugs that potentially affect P cell function,\nwe searched broadly for clinically approved and preclinical bioactive molecules\nwith drug-like properties that target GPCRs or ion channels. As a result, we\nfound drugs that target the GPCRs ADRB1, ADRB2, CHRM2 and GLP1R and the ion\nchannels CACNA1C, CACNA1D, CACNA1G, HCN4 and TRPV1 expressed in P cells\n(Extended Data Fig. 10a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig15] and Supplementary\nFig. 6 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). In\naddition, we found several drugs that block the angiotensin II receptor (encoded\nby AGTR1), which indicated that these drugs potentially have a direct effect on\nP cells.\n\nNotably, our analysis identified P-cell-expressed targets for non-cardiac\nmedications with documented chronotropic effects (Fig. 4b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig4] and Extended Data Fig.\n10a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig15]). These included\nthe antidiabetic medication liraglutide (a GLP-1 analogue) and the\nanti-epileptic medication perampanel (an AMPA receptor inhibitor) (Fig. 4b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig4] and Extended Data Fig.\n10a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig15]). Both drugs are\nknown to alter heart rate, but as their targets were not known to be present in\nP cells before this study, alternative sites of action (the ANS and CNS,\nrespectively) had been proposed as mediators of these effects37\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR37],38\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR38] (Fig. 4c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig4]).\n\nTo test the effect of GLP-1, we used human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived\ncardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), which exhibit pacemaker properties such as automatic\nfiring39 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR39].\nExpression of the pacemaker channel genes HCN4, HCN1 and GLP1R was confirmed at\nthe mRNA level and at the protein level by immunofluorescence staining (Extended\nData Fig. 10b,c [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig15]).\nLive imaging of intracellular calcium transients was performed on cells treated\nwith GLP-1 or ivabradine, a negative chronotropic agent that slows diastolic\ndepolarization by blocking pacemaker (HCN1 and HCN4) channels as a control.\nIvabradine treatment decreased spontaneous firing rates of hiPSC-CMs, as shown\nby an increase in the time between peak maximum (Pk2Pk) (Extended Data Fig. 10d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig15]). By contrast, GLP-1\nreduced the time between peak threshold and peak maximum (Time2Pk) value, which\nis indicative of a positive chronotropic effect (Extended Data Fig. 10e\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig15]). These results are\nconsistent with the documented chronotropic effects observed in patients treated\nwith GLP-1 analogues and suggest that the effect is at least partially mediated\nby a direct action on P cells (Fig. 4c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig4]).\n\nIn summary, drug2cell can identify specific cellular targets of bioactive\nmolecules with drug properties based on sc/snRNA-seq data, potentially revealing\nhidden mechanisms of action and predicting the impact of medicines on specific\ncell types.\n\n\nIMMUNE NICHE IN THE EPICARDIUM\n\nTo further understand the immune niche that incorporates epicardial plasma\nB cells (Fig. 2g [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig2] and\nExtended Data Fig. 11a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig16]), we localized\nplasma B cells and the associated genes encoding immunoglobulin heavy chains in\nthe spatial transcriptomics data. Genes encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chains\n(IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHG4 and IGHA1) were significantly enriched in the\nepicardium–subepicardium histological structure (Extended Data Fig. 11b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig16]), and the spots\nexpressing IGHG1 and IGHA1 showed distinct localization (Fig. 5a,b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig5] and Extended Data Fig.\n11c [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig16]). This result\nsuggests that different mechanisms regulate the fate of IgG+ and IgA+ plasma B\ncells within the epicardial–subepicardial niche.\n\nFig. 5: Immune niche in the epicardium.\nfigure 5\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06311-1/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6311_Fig5_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1/figures/5\n\na, Images show abundances of plasma B cells (estimated using cell2location),\nIGHG1 and IGHA1 expression, and annotations of histological structures in\nspatial transcriptomics sections from the RV region. b, Correlation between\npaired IGH gene expressions in the epicardium–subepicardium.

Illustrations in c,d,g were created\nusing BioRender (https://biorender.com [https://biorender.com/]).\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1/figures/5]\n\nTo understand the mechanisms that regulate the dynamics of this cellular niche,\nwe performed spatially resolved CellPhoneDB analysis (Extended Data Fig. 11d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig16]). Endothelial cells,\nFBs, mesothelial cells and MPs expressed genes encoding CCL2 and CXCL12 (also\nknown as SDF1), and plasma B cells expressed genes encoding their receptors,\nCCR2 and CXCR4, respectively (Fig. 5c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig5]). This result suggests\nthat plasma B cells may be recruited through a chemokine-dependent mechanism40\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR40]. Our data also\npointed towards a CCL28–CCR10 interaction, a specific mechanism for IgA+\nplasma B cell recruitment40\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR40], from lymphatic\nendothelial cells (EC8_ln) to plasma B cells (Fig. 5c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig5]). Ligand-encoding\ngenes TNFSF13B (which encodes BAFF) and TNFSF13 (which encodes APRIL) were\nexpressed in MPs, monocytes and FBs, whereas their receptor counterparts\nTNFRSF13B (which encodes TACI) and TNFRSF17 (which encodes BCMA) were expressed\nin plasma B cells (Fig. 5d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig5]). This result suggests\nthat tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily-dependent signalling contributes\nto the homeostasis of the niche41\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR41]. Consistent with\nour CellPhoneDB predictions, multiplex single-molecule fluorescence in situ\nhybridization (smFISH) analysis confirmed the colocalization of plasma B cells\nexpressing TNFRSF13B (which encodes the BAFF receptor) alongside MPs in the\nepicardium (Fig. 5e [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig5]).\nImmunofluorescence staining also confirmed the presence of IgA in the\nsubepicardial region (Fig. 5f\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig5]). Furthermore,\nCellPhoneDB predicted interactions between plasma B cells and FBs (FB2, FB3 and\nFB5), LYVE1+IGF1+ MPs and endothelial cells (EC6_vec and EC8_ln) through TGFβ1\nand TGFβ receptors (Extended Data Fig. 11e\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig16]). In line with a\nprevious study42 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR42]\nshowing a key role of plasma B cells in fibrosis, plasma B cells together with\nLYVE1+IGF1+ MP and endothelial cells were the major sources of TGFB1 (Extended\nData Fig. 11f [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig16]).\n\nThe manually annotated epicardial–subepicardium structure highly expressed genes\nfor secreted antimicrobial defence molecules, including SLPI and RARRES2\n(encoding chemerin)43\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR43], as well as\nmonocyte/neutrophil-attracting chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL6 and CXCL8). This result\nis consistent with the enrichment of these genes in mesothelial cells (Extended\nData Fig. 11g,h [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig16]), and\nsuggests that they have directly contribute to the immune defensive function of\nthe heart.\n\nIn summary, we defined a new epicardial niche in which MP-derived and\nstromal-cell-derived signals mediate the recruitment and homeostasis of plasma B\ncells that secrete immunoglobulins. These antibodies, together with other\nantimicrobial molecules, provide an immune barrier that protects the heart\nagainst lung-derived invading pathogens (Fig. 5g\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig5]), and its\ndysregulation could contribute to autoimmune mechanisms of cardiac disease44\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR44].\n\n\nVENTRICULAR MYOCARDIAL-STRESS NICHE\n\nFrom the results above, we noted activated FB cell states with high collagen\nexpression profiles (FB4_activated) and stressed ventricular CMs expressing\ncardiomyocyte stress signatures (vCM3_stressed) (Extended Data Fig. 2h\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). By testing their\nabundance in publicly available datasets of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and\nHCM45 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR45],46\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR46], we detected\nexpansions of FB4_activated and vCM3_stressed populations in both DCM and HCM\nsamples compared with samples from healthy individuals (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig17]). To validate this\nfinding, we examined ventricular myocardium samples from patients with DCM using\nmultiplex smFISH. This analysis revealed the colocalization and enrichment of\nmarker genes for FB4_activated (COL1A1) and vCM3_stressed (NPPB) cells in DCM\nsamples compared with controls (Extended Data Fig. 12c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig17]). Spatial\ntranscriptomics analysis of the SP region of donor hearts revealed\ncolocalization of these two cell states with vascular cells and immune cells\ndefining a myocardial stress niche (Extended Data Fig. 12d–f\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig17]). Spatially refined\nCellPhoneDB analysis suggested that the TGFβ superfamily contributed to\nintercellular communications within this microenvironment. Specifically,\nendothelial cells, smooth muscle cells (SMC2_art), FBs (FB4_activated and FB5)\nand immune cells (MPs and NK cells) expressed genes encoding TGFβ ligands. By\ncontrast, TGFβ receptors were expressed in both FB4_activated and vCM3_stressed\npopulations (Extended Data Fig. 12g\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig17]). Also, several\nendothelial cell populations and SMC2_art cells expressed inflammatory cytokines\n(IL6, TNFSF10 and TNFSF12), which interact with their cognate receptors\nexpressed in vCM3_stressed cells (Extended Data Fig. 12h\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig17]). This result\nindicates that there is direct proinflammatory signalling to the cardiomyocytes.\nIn fact, compared with other vCMs, vCM3_stressed cells expressed higher levels\nof genes encoding receptors for IL-6, TNFSF12 and IL-1 (IL6R, TNFRSF12A, and\nIL1R1 and IL1RAP, respectively) (Extended Data Fig. 12i\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig17]), which are\nassociated with the pathogenesis of heart failure44\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR44]. We speculate that\nthis myocardial-stress niche may be a precursor to adverse cardiac remodelling\nand pathogenic fibrosis typical of cardiomyopathy (Extended Data Fig. 12j\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig17]).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur work sheds new light on the cellular profiles and composition of niches in\nthe human heart. In the CCS, P cells expressed the TF FOXP2 and ion channel\ngenes not traditionally associated with cardiac pacemaking. These include\nmembers of the TRP family of non-selective cation channels for which their\nconductance is regulated by physicochemical stimuli and can modulate\ncardiomyocyte excitability47\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR47]. TRPM3, inhibited\nby the βγ-subunits of Gi/o-coupled GPCRs, has been implicated in SAN-associated\nand AVN-associated GWAS traits48\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR48],49\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR49] and could modulate\nP cell excitability in a fashion similar to GIRK channels50\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR50]. We also report\nANO6, which encodes a calcium-activated chloride channel, in human CCS cells.\nNotably, another member of the same anoctamin family (ANO1) is the primary\npacemaker channel responsible for peristaltic slow-wave generation in the Cajal\ncells of the gut13\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR13],51\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR51], and was detected\nin mouse SAN52 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR52]. We\ndeveloped drug2cell, a tool to identify drug-target expression at the\nsingle-cell level. This tool highlighted P cells as previously unknown cellular\ntargets for drugs with chronotropic side effects (including GLP-1 analogues and\nperampanel), the mechanisms of which had remained elusive37\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR37]. In the future,\napplying drug2cell to whole-body cell atlas datasets may improve in silico\nscreening by predicting adverse effects in cell types across all organs.\n\nThrough our spatial analyses, we showed that the glial population NC2_glial_NGF+\nis a niche partner of CCS cells in both nodes and the AV bundle. These cells\nexpress key elements required to maintain the glutamine pool and may therefore\nfacilitate cardiac glutamatergic signalling in an astrocyte-like role.\nSimilarly, our analysis highlighted multiple trans-synaptic adhesion\ninteractions suggesting a synapse-like interconnection, as supported by the\nenvelopment of P cells by glial processes. Consistent with the recently\nsuggested cardiomyocyte–neuron signalling circuit34\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR34], NC2_glial_NGF+\ncells may promote CCS innervation through the secretion of the neurotrophic\nfactor NGF, the receptors of which (NGFR and NTRK1) are expressed in the nearby\nRAGP. Together, these findings indicate an important multifaceted role for\nNC2_glial_NGF+ cells in supporting CCS cells.\n\nThe presence of IgA+ and IgG+ plasma B cells in the epicardium and subepicardium\nis consistent with a role as a barrier to direct invasion of pathogens such as\nthose infecting the neighbouring lungs. Mesothelial cells may have a key part in\nthe formation of the epicardial immune niche by expressing chemokines (CCL2) and\npro-survival factors for B cells (BAFF) and the immune defensive function by\nexpressing antimicrobial molecules (SLPI and RARRES2). This role is similar to\nthe immunoregulatory function of mesothelial cells in the peritoneal cavity53\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR53]. Within the\nmyocardium, we discovered a myocardial-stress niche with enrichment of genes\nencoding inflammatory cytokine receptors (IL-1 and IL-6 receptors) in the\nstressed CM population (vCM3_stressed). This result implies a mechanism that\nmediates the susceptibility of the heart to inflammation and remodelling within\nthe myocardial-stress niche44\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR44].\n\nThis framework, which combined multimodal data and integrated knowledge-based\nand unsupervised microstructural annotations, has the power to drive niche\ndiscovery and can be applied to other tissues in health and disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\n\n\nRESEARCH ETHICS FOR DONOR TISSUES\n\nAll heart tissue samples were obtained from transplant donors after Research\nEthics Committee approval and written informed consent from donor families as\npreviously described2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR2]. The following\nethics approvals for donors of additional heart tissue were obtained: D8 and A61\n(REC reference 15/EE/0152, East of England Cambridge South Research Ethics\nCommittee); AH1 (DN_A17), AH2 (DN_A18), AH5 (DN_A19) and AH6 (DN_A20) (REC\nreference 16/LO/1568, London, London Bridge Research Ethics Committee); AV1\n(HOPA03), AV3 (HOPB01), AV10 (HOPC05), AV13 (HOPA05) and AV14 (HOPA06) (REC\nreference 16/NE/0230, North East, Newcastle & North Tyneside Research Ethics\nCommittee). Samples of failing hearts used for validation were obtained under\nthe Research Ethic Committee approval given to the Royal Brompton & Harefield\nHospital Cardiovascular Research Centre Tissue Bank (REC reference 19/SC/0257).\n\n\nTISSUE ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING\n\nCardiovascular history was unremarkable for all donors (Supplementary Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM3]). Hearts\ncontributing to the SAN and AVN regions were from donors confirmed to be in\nsinus rhythm with normal conduction parameters by echocardiogram before donation\n(Supplementary Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM3]). Hearts were\nacquired after circulatory death (D8, A61, AH1, AH2, AH5 and AV3) and after\nbrain death (AV1, AV10, AV13, AV14 and AH6). For donation after circulatory\ndeath donors, after confirmation of death there was a mandatory 5-min stand-off\nbefore sternotomy. In all cases, the aorta was cross-clamped and cold\ncardioplegia solution was administered to the aortic root before cardiotomy.\nSamples AV1, AV3, AV10, AV13 and AV14 were procured in the standard fashion and\nthen immediately preserved with and transported on a hypothermic perfusion\nmachine. Sample AH2 was similarly preserved, but with immediate normothermic\nperfusion. It then underwent 4 h of normothermic perfusion before samples were\ntaken. For single nuclei sequencing, all donor samples were full-thickness\nmyocardial tissues from the SAN, the AVN, the LA, the RA, the LV, the RV, the SP\nand the AX. For spatial transcriptomics, ventricle regions, the thicknesses of\nwhich were larger than one side of the Visium frame (6.5 mm), were separated\ninto epicardial and endocardial portions. Samples used for single nuclei\nisolation and spatial transcriptomics were flash-frozen or frozen in OCT and\nstored at −80 °C, or formalin-fixed and subsequently embedded in paraffin\nblocks. All tissue samples were stored and transported on ice at all times until\nfreezing or tissue dissociation to minimize any transcriptional degradation.\n\n\nPREPARATION OF NODE SAMPLES\n\nFor the SAN, a 6 × 3 cm portion of the posterolateral RA with its long axis\nparallel to and centred on the crista terminalis was dissected. This was then\ndivided into 5-mm-thick strips cut perpendicular to the crista terminalis\n(Supplementary Fig. 1a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). For the AVN\nregion, a tissue sample including the triangle of Koch (bordered by Todaro’s\ntendon, the coronary sinus ostium and the tricuspid valve annulus) as well as\nthe basal septum (spanning from the interatrial to interventricular septum and\nincluding the membranous septum) was dissected (Supplementary Fig. 1b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). As before, the\nsample was then divided into strips that were cut perpendicular to the tricuspid\nannular plane. Each strip was then embedded in OCT medium and frozen, retaining\ninformation of its position in the septum–lateral wall axis. As confirmed by H&E\nstaining, the lateral portions captured AV nodal tissue, whereas the septal\nportions included the AVB and its branches.\n\n\nSINGLE NUCLEI ISOLATION\n\nSingle nuclei were obtained from flash-frozen tissues using sectioning and\nmechanical homogenization as previously described2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR2],54\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR54]. Slices of 5–10 mm\nthickness from frozen tissue were first sectioned with a cryostat in a 50-μm\nthickness section. All sections from each sample were homogenized using a 7 ml\nglass Dounce tissue grinder set (Merck) with 8–10 strokes of a loose pestle (A)\nand 8–10 strokes of a tight pestle (B) in homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose,\n25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1× protease\ninhibitor, 0.4 U μl−1 RNaseIn, 0.2 U μl−1 SUPERaseIn and 0.1% Triton X-100 in\nnuclease-free water). Homogenate was filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer\n(Corning). After centrifugation (500g, 5 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was removed\nand the pellet was resuspended in storage buffer (1× PBS, 4% BSA and 0.2 U μl−1\nProtector RNaseIn). Nuclei were stained with 7-AAD viability staining solution\n(BioLegend), and positive single nuclei were purified by FACS using a MA900\nMulti-Application Cell Sorter (Sony) and its proprietary software (Cell Sorter\nv.3.1.1) (Supplementary Fig. 7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). Nuclei\npurification and integrity were verified by microscopy, and nuclei were further\nprocessed for multiome paired RNA and ATAC-seq using Chromium Controller (10x\nGenomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\n\nCHROMIUM 10X LIBRARY PREPARATION\n\nSingle nuclei were manually counted by Trypan blue exclusion. Nuclei suspension\nwas adjusted to 1,000–3,000 nuclei per microlitre and loaded on a Chromium\nController (10x Genomics) with a targeted nuclei recovery of 5,000–10,000 per\nreaction. Next, 3′ gene expression libraries and ATAC libraries were prepared\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions from Chromium Single Cell ATAC and\nmultiome ATAC+Gene Expression kits (10x Genomics). Quality control of cDNA and\nfinal libraries was done using Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Analysis\n(Agilent) or a 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent). Libraries were sequenced using\na NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) at the Wellcome Sanger Institute with a minimum depth\nof 20,000–30,000 read pairs per nucleus.\n\n\nVISIUM SLIDES AND LIBRARY PREPARATION\n\nFor fresh-frozen samples, samples were frozen and embedded in OCT medium using a\ndry ice-cooled bath of isopentane at −45 °C. OCT-embedded samples were sectioned\nusing a cryostat (Leica CX3050S) and were cut at 10 μm.\n\nFor formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, fresh samples were fixed in\n>5 times their volume of 4% v/v formalin at ambient temperature for 24 h before\nprocessing to paraffin on a Tissue-Tek Vacuum Infiltration Processor 5 (Sakura\nFinetek). FFPE blocks were sectioned at 5 μm using a microtome (Leica RM2125RT).\n\nSamples of the microanatomical regions of interest (ROIs) were selected on the\nbasis of morphology with expert review (S.Y.H.), orientation (based on H&E\nstaining) and either RNA integrity number (fresh-frozen samples) or DV200\n(formalin-fixed) that was obtained using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. In\naddition, FFPE tissues were checked for possible detachment issues using 10x\nGenomics Adhesion test slides. FFPE Visium Spatial Gene Expression (10x\nGenomics) was performed following the manufacturer’s protocol. For fresh-frozen\nsamples, the Tissue Optimization protocol from 10x Genomics was performed to\nobtain a permeabilization time of 45 min, and the FF Visium Spatial Gene\nExpression experiment was performed as per the manufacturer’s protocol (10x\nGenomics). H&E-stained Visium Gene Expression slides were imaged at ×40\nmagnification on a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S60. After transcript capture, the\nVisium Library Preparation protocol from 10x Genomics was performed. Eight cDNA\nlibraries were diluted and pooled to a final concentration of 2.25 nM (200 μl\nvolume) and sequenced on 2× SP flow cells of an Illumina NovaSeq 6000.\n\n\nREAD MAPPING\n\nAfter sequencing, samples were demultiplexed and stored as CRAM files. Each\nsample of sc/snRNA-seq was mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38-3.0.0)\nprovided by 10x Genomics and using the CellRanger software (v.3.0.2) or STARsolo\n(v.2.7.3a) with default parameters. For single nuclei samples, the reference for\npre-mRNA was created using the method provided by 10x Genomics\n(https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/references\n[https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/references]).\nEach sample of multiome, or Visium, were mapped to the human reference genome\n(multiome: GRCh38-2020-A-2.0.0; Visium: GRCh38-3.0.0) provided by 10x Genomics\nusing CellRanger ARC (v.2.0.0) or SpaceRanger (v.1.1.0) with default parameters.\nFor Visium samples, SpaceRanger was also used to align paired histology images\nwith mRNA capture spot positions in the Visium slides. Part of the SAN samples\nwere mixed with different donors after the nuclei isolation for cost-efficient\nexperimental design (Supplementary Table 8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM10]) and\ncomputationally demultiplexed (Soupercell, v.2.0)55\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR55] on the basis of\ngenetic variation between the donors.\n\n\nQUALITY CONTROL AND PROCESSING OF DATA\n\nFor sc/snRNA-seq and multiome gene expression data, the CellBender algorithm56\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR56]\n(remove-background) was applied to remove ambient and background RNA from each\ncount matrix produced using the CellRanger pipeline. Python (v.3), Pandas\n(v.1.3.5), NumPy (v.1.21.5), Matplotlib (v.3.5.2) and Scanpy (v.1.8.2 and\nv.1.9.1) were used for quality control and downstream processing. Cells or\nnuclei for each sample were filtered for more than 200 genes and less than 20%\n(cells) or 5% (nuclei) mitochondrial and ribosomal reads. A Scrublet57\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR57] (v.0.2.3) score\ncutoff value of 0.3 of was applied to remove doublets. The Scanpy toolkit was\nused to perform downstream processing.\n\nFor multiome ATAC data (10x Genomics), the data processed using CellRanger ARC\nwere further analysed using ArchR (v.1.0.2)58\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR58]. Quality control\nwas performed, considering, among other factors, transcription start site\nenrichment, nucleosomal banding patterns, the number and fraction of fragments\nin peaks, reads falling into ENCODE blacklist regions as well as doublet scores\ncomputed by ArchR. For high-quality cells, reads were mapped to 500-bp bins\nacross the reference genome (hg38) (TileMatrix). Gene scores based on chromatin\naccessibility around genes were computed from TileMatrix using the\ncreateArrowFiles function to check their consistency with measured expression\nvalues. Before peak calling, pseudo-bulk replicates were generated\n(addGroupCoverages) for each fine-grained cell state annotated using the paired\ngene expression data. Peak calling (501 bp fixed-width peaks) was performed for\neach cell state, and the peak sets were merged to obtain a unified peak set\n(addReproduciblePeakSet). A cell-by-peak count matrix was obtained using the\naddPeakMatrix function.\n\nFor Visium data, the Scanpy toolkit was used for quality control and downstream\nprocessing. Visium spots of each sample were filtered for more than 500 UMI\ncounts and 300 genes.\n\n\nDATA INTEGRATION AND CELL-TYPE ANNOTATION\n\nAll transcriptome data were integrated using scVI59\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR59] (v.0.14.5,\nn_hidden=128, n_latent=50, n_layers=3, dispersion=‘gene-batch’) and scArches60\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR60] (v.0.5.5,\nn_hidden=128, n_latent=50, n_layers=3, dispersion=‘gene-batch’) with correcting\nbatch effects (donor, cells or nuclei, and 10x Genomics library generation kits)\nand removing unwanted source of variations (total counts, per cent mitochondrial\ngenes and per cent ribosomal genes for ‘continuous_covariate_keys’). Scanpy\nfunctions were used to compute a neighbourhood graph of observations based on\nthe scVI latent space (scanpy.pp.neighbors) and to perform dimensionality\nreduction (scanpy.tl.umap) and Leiden clustering (scanpy.tl.leiden,\nresolution = 1.0). Clusters showing hybrid transcriptional signatures that also\nhad a high scrublet score were removed. After re-clustering, cell lineages were\nannotated on the basis of the expression of major marker genes and statistically\nidentified marker gene expression for each cluster\n(scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups).\n\nTo identify fine-grained cell states of the CCS, aCMs of the SAN were\nsubclustered; thus we identified a cluster of P cells (SAN_P_cell) that\nexpressed canonical channel genes (HCN1 and HCN4)61\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR61] and a TF (TBX3)\n(Fig. 1c [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1] and Extended\nData Fig. 2a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]).\nSubclustering of AVN aCMs and vCMs showed two CCS cell state clusters (AVN\npacemaker cell; AVN_P_cell and AVB cell; AV_bundle) (Fig. 1d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1]). AVB cells formed a\ndistinct cluster defined by an enrichment in GJA5 (which encodes Cx40), CRNDE\nand CNTN5, which were previously identified as a marker of His bundle cells in\nthe mouse heart9 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR9]\n(Extended Data Fig. 2c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). To identify Purkinje\ncells, CM populations from AVN samples were integrated and clustered with those\nfrom the AX. This analysis showed one cluster (cluster 8) that contained not\nonly the CCS cells from the AVN but also a population derived from the AX\nexpressing Purkinje cell marker genes (GJA5, IRX3, KCNJ3 and MYL4)62\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR62] (Fig. 1e\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig1] and Extended Data Fig.\n2d,e [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]).\n\nCell states of other cell types and other regions were defined by label transfer\n(scNym)63 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR63] using a\npublished dataset2 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR2]\nas a reference with revised annotations. The new annotations include neural cell\npopulations, which express pan-glial markers and lack core neuronal markers\n(Extended Data Fig. 2i\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]); therefore this\ncompartment is best described as glia and will be described below with the\n‘_glial’ suffix. FB4 was renamed as FB4_activated based on FB-activation\nsignature genes (POSTN and TNC) and genes encoding ECM proteins (COL1A1, COL1A2,\nCOL3A1 and FN1) (Extended Data Fig. 2h,j\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). vCM3 was renamed as\nvCM3_stressed based on the specific expression of NPPB, which encodes B-type\nnatriuretic peptide (BNP), which is a diagnostic marker for HF and a valuable\nprognostic predictor for the entire spectrum of disease severity and expressed\nin stressed CMs64 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR64]\n(Extended Data Fig. 2h,k\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig7]). EC7_atria was\nrenamed as EC7_endocardial based on a recently published study45\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR45]. For myeloid\ncells, dimensionality reduction and batch correction (scVI) with Leiden\nclustering were repeated to identify and annotate fine-grained cell states, such\nas tissue-resident LYVE1+ MPs65\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR65], based on the\nmarkers (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). The transferred\ncell state labels that were not consistent with the coarse-grained cell-type\nlabels based on the global clusters were replaced with ‘unclassified’ and\nexcluded from downstream analyses.\n\nsnATAC-seq data were integrated using cell-by-peak count matrix and peakVI66\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR66] (v.0.19.0) with\ncorrection for batch effects (donor). Scanpy functions were used to compute a\nneighbourhood graph of observations based on the peakVI latent space\n(scanpy.pp.neighbors) and to perform dimensionality reduction (scanpy.tl.umap).\n\n\nSPATIAL MAPPING OF CELL STATES WITH CELL2LOCATION\n\nTo spatially map heart cell states defined by single-cell transcriptomics data\nanalysis in the Visium data, we used our cell2location (v.0.1) method11\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR11],67\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR67]. In brief, we\nfirst estimated reference signatures of cell states using sc/snRNA-seq data of\neach region and a negative binomial regression model provided in the\ncell2ocation package. For the cell types that had fewer than 100 cells or nuclei\nper region, cells or nuclei from all the regions were used for the reference\nsignature inference. The inferred reference cell state signatures were used for\ncell2location cell-type mapping for corresponding regions that estimate the\nabundance of each cell state in each Visium spot by decomposing spot mRNA\ncounts. The H&E images of the Visium slides were used to determine the average\nnumber of nuclei per Visium spot (n = 7) in the tissue and used as a\nhyperparameter in the cell2location pipeline. For Visium–FFPE sections (Extended\nData Fig. 6c,d [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig11]), cell\nstate proportions in each Visium spot were calculated based on the estimated\ncell state abundances.\n\n\nCELL STATE SPATIAL ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS\n\nAnatomical microstructures of spatial transcriptomics data were manually\nannotated using the paired histology images as follows: epicardium,\nsubepicardium, endocardium, myocardium, vessel, nerve, adipose tissue,\ncardiac_skeleton, fibrosis, node, AVB and Purkinje cell. Cell state proportions\nper spot were calculated based on the estimated abundance of cell states\n(cell2location). Cell state enrichments (odds ratio) in each structure were\ncalculated by dividing the odds of target cell state proportions by the odds of\nthe other cell state proportions. Odds of cell proportions were calculated as\nthe ratio of cell proportion in the spots of a structure of interest to that in\nthe other spots. Significance was obtained by chi-square analysis\n(scipy.stats.chi2_contingency) and the P value was corrected using the\nBenjamini–Hochberg method.\n\nThe mapping of expected cell types to histologically defined structures such as\nEC7_endocardial in the endocardium, glial cells (NC1_glial) in the nerve,\narterial smooth muscle cells (SMC2_art) in the vessel, and FBs and MPs in\nfibrosis structures (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]) provided further\nvalidation of the spatial mapping method.\n\n\nCELLULAR MICROENVIRONMENT DISCOVERY\n\nThe NMF analysis implemented in the cell2location pipeline was performed on the\nspatial mapping results of each anatomical region of the heart. The NMF model\nwas trained for a range of cell state combinations (number of factors: n_fact)\nN={5,...,14}, and the effect size of the cell state group abundance between the\nspots within a given structure against the spots in the other areas was\ncalculated for each factor (95 factors in total) (Supplementary Fig. 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1], step 1). To test\nthe significance, we permuted the annotation labels of all spots and generated a\nnull distribution of the effect size. The P values were calculated on the basis\nof the proportion of the value that is as high as or higher than the actual\neffect size. For each given structure, we first selected the factor that has the\nhighest significant effect size (best-factor) (Supplementary Fig. 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1], step 2). Next, we\nselected the n_fact that had multiple numbers of factors (fine-factors) with an\neffect size more than an arbitrary proportion (0.5) of the best-factor\n(Supplementary Fig. 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1], step 3). We\nconsidered the fine-factors as refined microenvironments, which were identified\nusing the NMF method (and not with the knowledge-based structural annotations).\n\nFor the myocardial-stress niche, first the estimated abundance values\n(cell2location) of FB4_activated and vCM3_stressed cells were multiplied. Based\non the multiplied abundance, clusters of neighbouring spots (n > 5) that had\nhigher than a value of (0.03) were selected.\n\n\nCELLPHONEDB NEURAL–GPCR EXPANSION MODULE\n\nUsing the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)68\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR68] library of GPCRs\nas a master list (HGNC group 139), we used publicly available databases\n(UniProt, Reactome, IUPHAR and GPCRdb (https://gpcrdb.org/\n[https://gpcrdb.org/])69\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR69]) to generate a set\nof GPCRs with known ligands. To generate ligand–receptor interactions for these\nGPCRs, we used ligand genes (for gene-encoded ligands). For non-gene-encoded\nligands (such as small-molecule ligands), we used ligand proxies in the form of\nspecific biosynthetic enzymes or transporter genes. Additionally, we added new\ntrans-synaptic adhesion molecule interactions29\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR29],70\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR70],71\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR71]. Together, this\nformed more than 800 new interactions (Supplementary Tables 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM5] and 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM6]), which we used with\nthe user-defined ‘database generate’ function in CellPhoneDB7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR7].\n\n\nSPATIALLY RESOLVED CELL–CELL INTERACTION ANALYSIS\n\nCellPhoneDB7 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR7],72\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR72] analyses with a\ncustom neural–GPCR expansion module were performed on the identified niches and\nthe cell state components. Overall, the cell–cell interaction inferences were\nperformed using single-cell transcriptomics data of each anatomical region and\nby restricting to the cell states that were colocalized in the identified\ncellular niches.\n\nFor CCS and myocardial-stress niches, we selected the cell states that were\neither in the node of the SAN or the AVN and retrieved the interacting pairs of\nligands and receptors that satisfied the following criteria: (1) all the members\nwere expressed in at least 10% of the cells in the cell states; and (2)\nligand–receptor complexes specific to two cell states were inferred by the\nstatistical method framework in CellPhoneDB (‘statistical_analysis’, P value\nthreshold = 0.05).\n\nFor epicardial–subepicardial niches, the ligand–receptor interactions of the\ncolocalized cell states were retrieved on the basis of the following criteria:\n(1) all the members were expressed in at least 10% of the cell states; and (2)\nat least one of the members in the ligand or the receptor was a differentially\nexpressed gene (DEG) compared with other cell states\n(scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups, P value threshold = 0.05, log2(fold change)\nthreshold = 0.1). The ligand–receptor interactions were further selected on the\nbasis of mean expression levels and the biological questions as indicated in the\nResults and the figure legends.\n\nThe following HGNC annotations were used for selecting some of the\nligand–receptor interactions: chemokines (HGNC GID:189), cytokines (HGNC\nGID:599, 602, 1932, 781 and 1264), and LGIC (HGNC GID:GID161).\n\nThe following cell states were used in each analysis: SAN (SAN_P_cell, FB2,\nFB4_activated, FB5, FB6, NC2_glial_NGF+ and LYVE1+IGF1+ MP); AVN (AVN_P_cell,\naCM2, FB1, FB2, FB5, SMC1_basic, SMC2_art, NC2_glial_NGF+, LYVE1+IGF1+ MP and\nmast); epicardial–subepicardial niche (meso, EC6_ven, EC8_ln, PC2_atria,\nLYVE1+IGF1+ MP, B_plasma, T/NK_cycling, FB2, FB3, FB5 and NC1_glial); and\nmyocardial-stress niche (FB3, FB4_activated, FB5, vCM3_stressed, EC2_cap,\nEC3_cap, EC4_immune, EC6_ven, PC3_str, SMC2_art, LYVE1+IGF1+ MP, MoMP and\nNK_CD16hi).\n\n\nION CHANNEL AND GPCR PROFILE\n\nDifferential gene expression analysis with t-test method was performed using the\nScanpy function scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups. Only multiome gene expression data\nwere used to avoid the technical batch effects due to kit differences. P value\ncorrection was performed using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Each of the CCS\ncells (SAN_P_cell, AVN_P_cell, AV_bundle_cell and Purkinje cells) was compared\nwith non-CCS aCMs as a reference (Supplementary Table 2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM4]). Genes were deemed\ndifferentially expressed with an adjusted P value of < 0.05. DEGs encoding for\nion channels and GPCRs were selected based on HGNC groups 177 and 139,\nrespectively. Upregulated (log2(fold change) > 0) DEGs were depicted in the GPCR\noverview schematic (Fig. 3b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3]). To compare the\ntranscriptional similarity of working (aCM, vCM) and CCS cell states, a\ndendrogram based on principal-component-analysis-reduced gene expression was\ncomputed using the Scanpy function scanpy.tl.dendrogram (Extended Data Fig. 8c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]).\n\n\nMOUSE DEG ANALYSIS\n\nA list of upregulated ion channel genes (log2(fold change) > 1, adjusted\nP value < 0.01) for SAN_P_cells was made. Differentially expressed testing\nsummary statistics from two mouse single-cell studies were obtained52\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR52],73\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR73]. In both studies,\ndifferentially expressed testing was conducted by comparing sinoatrial CMs\n(P cells) against all other cells. Genes orthologous to the list of upregulated\n(human) P cell genes were identified in the mouse differentially expressed\nsummary statistics (using the NCBI Orthologs database as a reference). The\ndifferentially expressed statistics (log2(fold change), –log(P value)) from the\nmouse are plotted. Human and mouse data were not integrated.\n\n\nIDENTIFICATION OF LIGANDS IN VISIUM DATA\n\nFour spatial transcriptomics, sections were identified as containing the RAGP by\nan expert anatomist (S.Y.H.). Spot counts from the Visium–FFPE sections that\ncontained RAGP were normalized, and spots were scored for the expression of four\ngeneric pan-neuronal cytoskeletal markers (PRPH, NEFL, NEFM and NEFH) using the\nSCANPY sc.tl.gene_score() function. Correlation of individual gene expression\nprofiles with this score was calculated (Pearson r and P value for each gene).\nThe ligand/ligand-proxy list created as part of the CellPhoneDB neural–GPCR\nmodule was used to identify ‘ligand’ genes among the set of correlated genes.\n\n\nGENE REGULATORY NETWORK\n\nThe Scenic pipeline74\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR74],75\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR75] was used\n(pySCENIC, v.0.11.2) to predict TFs and putative target genes regulated in\nP cells. First, gene regulatory interactions were calculated based on\nco-expression (either positively or negatively correlated) across the\nsingle-cell transcriptomics datasets of aCMs (using only multiome data) with\nGRNBoost2 (ref. 76\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR76]). This was\nfollowed by pruning interactions using known TF-binding motifs and the\nconstruction of dataset-specific regulatory modules (regulons)77\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR77]. Regulons were\nthen scored in each individual cell using AUCell. P-cell-relevant TFs and target\ngenes were retrieved based on the following criteria: (1) regulator TFs that are\nDEGs in P cells compared with other aCMs (scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups, with only\nmultiome data, P value threshold = 0.05, log2(fold change) threshold = 0.5);\n(2a) for activating regulons, target genes that were expressed in at least 10%\nand differentially expressed in P cells compared with other aCMs (same criteria\nas TF selection); and (2b) for repressor regulons, target genes that were\nexpressed at low levels in P cells compared with other aCMs (P value\nthreshold = 0.05, log2(fold change) threshold = −0.5). A network of regulatory\nTFs and target genes was then constructed by linking individual regulons to\ncreate a graph (NetworkX, v.2.6.3) (Fig. 3c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3] and Extended Data Fig.\n8i [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]). The node colour\nof the target genes is based on the class GPCR (HGNC and GID139), ion channel\n(HGNC and GID177) or TFs78\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR78].\n\nThe interactions of regulatory TFs and target genes were also inferred using the\nsnATAC-seq data and ArchR (v.1.0.2)58\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR58]. TF-binding motifs\nin the identified peaks were searched (addMotifAnnotations, motifSet=“cisbp”),\nand correlations between peak accessibility and gene expression were analysed\n(addPeak2GeneLinks and getPeak2GeneLinks, correlation > 0.2 or < −0.2,\nFDR < 1 × 10–4) using the multiome data of aCMs. TFs and potential target gene\ninteractions were obtained by combining the two results (Supplementary Fig. 5c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM1]). The inferred\ninteractions are highlighted in red in the activator network graph (Fig. 3c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig3]) and blue in the\nrepressor network graph (Extended Data Fig. 8i\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#Fig13]).\n\n\nGWAS SNP ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS\n\nTo create a list of SNPs associated with various physiological and pathological\ncardiovascular traits, index SNPs (meeting genome-wide significance) were first\nextracted from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog79\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR79] using the R\npackage gwasrapidd80\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR80]. Index SNPs were\nadded to by SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium (r2 > 0.8) based on\n1000 Genomes (phase 3) European samples, obtained using the Ensembl API80\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR80],81\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR81], with the window\nsize set to the default 500 kb.\n\nFor each nucleus barcode in the snATAC-seq dataset, counts of each identified\npeak was binarized (1 if the read count was >0). The binarized barcode by peak\nmatrix was then aggregated by cell state (defined using the paired gene\nexpression data) to form a cell state-by-peak matrix, in which a peak was\ndefined as open for a given cell state if the binarized count was 1 in at least\n5% of that population.\n\nTo calculate enrichment, a permutation test was performed using a previously\ndescribed method82\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR82]. For each cell\nstate, a random background was created by shuffling the open/closed labels of\nthe peaks of that cell state such that a random set of peaks were annotated as\nopen, the number of which equalled the actual number of open peaks for that cell\nstate. This was repeated to create 1,000 random permutations. For each trait and\ncell state, the proportion of trait-associated SNPs falling within the open\npeaks of that cell state was calculated (the SNP proportion). This SNP\nproportion was also calculated for each of the 1,000 random permutations. A\nP value could then be calculated as the fraction of times the random SNP\nproportion exceeded or was equal to the real SNP proportion. Finally, these\nP values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg\nmethod.\n\n\nDRUG2CELL\n\nDrug and target gene information was obtained from ChEMBL83\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR83],84\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR84] (v.30). Drugs were\nfiltered based on targeting organisms (Homo sapiens), achieved phase in a\nclinical trial (max_phase=4, clinically approved), and functionally active or\nnot. The activity (pChEMBL) threshold was specifically set for each family of\ntarget molecules according to the IDG project\n(https://druggablegenome.net/ProteinFam\n[https://druggablegenome.net/ProteinFam]) (kinases: ≦30 nM; GPCRs: ≦100 nM;\nnuclear hormone receptors: ≦100 nM; ion channels: ≦10 μM; others: ≦30 nM)\n(Supplementary Table 9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM11]). Clinically\napproved drugs were categorized based on the WHO ATC classification\n(https://www.who.int/tools/atc-ddd-toolkit/atc-classification\n[https://www.who.int/tools/atc-ddd-toolkit/atc-classification]). Drug scores in\neach single cell were calculated based on the target gene expression levels.\nScore were obtained by taking the mean of a set of target genes either without\n(method=’mean’) or with (method=’seurat’) subtracting with the mean expression\nof a reference set of genes85\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR85]. The reference set\nwas randomly sampled from the gene pool for each binned expression value. For\nthe drug repurposing analysis, all the drugs tested and selected were ones that\nhad the statistically highest score in a cell type of interest by testing with\nWilcoxon sum test, and P values were adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg\nmethod. For the drugs targeting GPCRs or ion channels, we searched the\nclinically approved (maximum phase: 4) and preclinical bioactive molecules with\ndrug-like properties (maximum phase: 1–3) that target genes encoding GPCRs (HGNC\nGID:139) or ion channels (HGNC GID:177). The drug2cell Python package is\navailable at GitHub (https://github.com/Teichlab/drug2cell\n[https://github.com/Teichlab/drug2cell]).\n\n\nIN VITRO VALIDATION OF CHRONOTROPIC EFFECTS OF GLP-1\n\nCELL CULTURE\n\nhiPSC-derived CMs (hiPSC-CM) were differentiated and maintained as previously\ndescribed86 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR86],87\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR87]. In brief, IMR90\nhiPSCs from WiCell88\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR88] were seeded onto\nplates coated with Matrigel (Corning, 356231) in TeSR-E8 medium (StemCell\nTechnologies, 05990) with 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, Y0503).\nThe next day, the medium was switched to TeSR-E8 without Y-27632. Media were\nsubsequently changed daily. Before starting the differentiation into CMs, the\ncells were replated twice using 0.5 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher, 15575020, diluted\n1:1,000 in PBS (Gibco, 20012027)) at room temperature for 6 min to detach them\nbefore plating. For the differentiation process, cells that reached 90%\nconfluency were treated for 2 days with 5 μM CHIR-99021 (Tocris, 4423) in RPMI\n1640 (Gibco, 11875119) supplemented with B27, minus insulin (Gibco, A1895602).\nOn day 2, the cell culture medium was replaced with RPMI/ B27, minus insulin.\nFor the next 2 days, 2 μM Wnt-C59 (Biorbyt, orb181132) was added in RPMI/B27,\nminus insulin. Cells were then cultured in RPMI/B27, minus insulin, with media\nchanges every 2 days. hiPSC-CM contraction was observed between days 8 and 10.\nOn day 11, the cells were placed in starvation medium (RPMI without glucose\n(Gibco, 11879020) supplemented with B27 (Gibco, 17504044)) for 2 days to improve\npurity. On day 15, the cells were detached using TrypLE select enzyme (10×)\n(Life Technologies, A1217702) and replated at a density of 2 × 106 per well in\nRPMI/B27, 10% KOSR (Thermo Fisher, 10828028) and 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride.\nThe cells were then cultured in RPMI/B27, and media were changed every 2 days.\n\nGENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS OF HIPSC-CMS\n\nBulk RNA-seq data from IMR90-derived CMs, deposited into the Sequence Read\nArchive public repository with accession number PRJNA629893\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA629893], were analysed as\npreviously described89\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR89]. Transcripts per\nmillion (TPM), indicating the normalized amplitude of gene expression, were used\nto examine gene expression. The TPM was calculated by dividing the read counts\nby gene length and the total number of exon reads, and then multiplied by the\nscaling factor of 1,000,000 (ref. 90\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR90]).\n\nCALCIUM IMAGING AND QUANTIFICATION\n\nhiPSC-CMs were stained for calcium imaging 30–35 days after the differentiation\nprotocol was started. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 100,000 cells cm–2\ndensity 1 week before imaging and staining. On the day of imaging, cells were\ngently washed with phenol-red-free RPMI (Thermo Fisher, 11835063), then stained\nwith 1 μM Fluo-4 (Thermo Fisher, F14201) solution and incubated at 37 °C for\n40 min. After incubation, the Fluo-4 solution was replaced with fresh,\npre-warmed phenol-red-free RPMI. Then, hiPSC-CMs were transferred to a\nmicroscopy humidified chamber (pre-set at 37 °C with 5% CO2) and allowed to\nacclimatize for 10 min. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axio Observer inverted\nwidefield microscope with a ×20/0.8 objective. The time series experiment was\nperformed with 10 ms exposure time on the Fluo-4 channel (excitation 494 nm,\nemission 516 nm), and recorded for 10 s at 100 f.p.s. Stage positions for each\nwell were stored to allow recurrence after drug treatment. All wells were\nscanned for baseline calcium transients. Then, hiPSC-CMs were treated with\nivabradine (Sigma, SML0281), GLP-1 (Tocris, 2082) or the corresponding vehicles\n(DMSO for ivabradine and water for GLP-1). After 20 min, cells were scanned\nagain using the same configuration.\n\nQuantification of calcium imaging videos was performed using Fiji (v.2.1.0). To\ncorrect the intensity decay due to photobleaching, the Fiji bleach correction\nplugin (exponential fit method) was applied to the raw image series. Then,\ncorrected image series were divided by their minimum intensity to remove\nbackground. A confluent region (containing at least 20 cells) was selected for\nquantification. Spiky plugin (https://github.com/PCCV/Spiky\n[https://github.com/PCCV/Spiky])91\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#ref-CR91] was used to\nautomate peak detection and quantification. Amplitude (peak value minus baseline\nvalue), Pk2Pk (time between two consecutive peaks), Time2Pk (time between\nthreshold to the peak) and RW50 (time at 50% of amplitude from peak to next\nbaseline at right) were averaged from multiple peaks detected. All results were\nnormalized to the corresponding baseline values.\n\nStatistical tests were performed in Prism 9 using D’Agostino and Pearson test to\ntest for normal distribution. Unpaired t-test was used to compare vehicle and\ntreated groups. P < 0.05 was regarded as significant.\n\nIMMUNOFLUORESCENCE STAINING OF CELLS\n\nhiPSC-CMs were fixed in 3.7% formalin in PBS then either blocked and\npermeabilized in 4% (w/v) BSA (Sigma Aldrich, A3059) and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100\n(Thermo Fisher, 85111) in PBS (Gibco, 20012027) (for HCN1 and HCN4 staining) or\nblocked in 1% (w/v) BSA and 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (EDM Millipore,\nS26-100ML) in PBS (for GLP1R staining) for 30 min at room temperature.\nIncubation with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM12]) diluted in BSA,\nTriton X-100 and PBS (HCN1 and HCN4) or BSA, goat serum and PBS (GLP1R) was done\novernight at 4 °C. Isotype controls and secondary antibody only (Supplementary\nTable 10 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM12]) stainings\nwere performed as negative controls. Following three washes with PBS, cells were\nstained with secondary antibodies diluted in BSA, Triton X-100 and PBS or BSA,\ngoat serum and PBS was done for 1 h at room temperature (Supplementary Table 10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM12]). After three\nwashes in PBS, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) for 15 min\nat room temperature. DAPI was rinsed and PBS was added to the cells. Confocal\nimaging acquisition was performed using a Zeiss LSM-780 inverted microscope with\na EC Plan Neofluar ×40/1.3 oil objective at the Imperial College London\nHammersmith FILM facility using 405 nm, 488 nm and 633 nm lasers for excitation.\nImage processing was performed in Fiji (v.2.1.0).\n\n\nSMFISH\n\nThe FFPE-embedded heart tissue sections (with a thickness of 5 μm) were placed\nonto SuperFrost Plus slides. Staining with a RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent\nReagent kit v2 assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Bio-Techne) was automated using\na Leica BOND RX, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The tissues were\nbaked and dewaxed on the Leica Bond RX, followed by the application of a\nheat-induced epitope retrieval step with epitope retrieval 2 for 15 min at 95 °C\nand protease digestion with protease III for 15 min. Subsequent processing\nincluded RNAscope probe hybridization and channel development with Opal 520,\nOpal 570 and Opal 650 dyes (Akoya Biosciences) at a concentration of 1:1,000,\nand streptavidin-conjugated Atto-425 (Bio Trend) at a concentration of 1:400\nusing TSA-biotin (TSA Plus Biotin Kit, Perkin Elmer). All nuclei were DAPI\nstained. Stained sections were imaged using a Perkin Elmer Opera Phenix\nHigh-Content Screening System with a ×20 water-immersion objective (NA of 0.16,\n0.299 μm per pixel). The following channels were used: DAPI (excitation, 375 nm;\nemission, 435–480 nm); Opal 520 (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 500–550 nm); Opal\n570 (excitation, 561 nm; emission, 570–630 nm); Opal 650 (excitation, 640 nm;\nemission, 650–760 nm); and Atto 425 (excitation, 425 nm; emission, 463–501 nm).\nStained sections were also imaged on a Hamamatsu S60 with a ×40 objective\n(0.23 μm per pixel).\n\n\nRNASCOPE QUANTIFICATION\n\nQuantification of RNAscope images was performed using ImageJ. To remove\nbackground, each channel was initially normalized using the following steps: (1)\nsubtracting the raw image with a Gaussian blur transformation with σ = 50; (2)\nperforming a background subtraction with rolling ball radius of 50 pixels; and\n(3) setting every pixel with an intensity lower than 40 (of an 8-bit image) to\n0. Following normalization, each section was quantified with sequential ROIs of\n200 × 200 μm. To avoid any bias due to the placement of the initial ROI,\nquantification was performed over three rounds, with the initial ROI displaced\nby 50 μm in the x and y axis in each round. The following parameters were\nrecorded per ROI: number of nuclei; COL1A1 area; and NPPB area.\n\nFor data analysis, to avoid variation due to cell density, for each ROI, COL1A1\nand NPPB areas were normalized by dividing the area value by the number of\nnuclei in the ROI. Only ROIs with more than ten nuclei were considered for\nanalysis. An ROI was only considered to contain a COL1A1 or NPPB niche if the\nstaining area was equal to or higher than 1 μm2. To avoid any confounding effect\ndue to different section sizes, we quantified the increase in the number of\nCOL1A1 and NPPB niches through the average ROI percentage, consisting of the\nnumber of COL1A1 or NPPB niche ROI divided by the total number of ROI, averaged\nover the three rounds of quantitation. To quantify the expression of COL1A1 and\nNPPB, we averaged the normalized area of each ROI per niche over the three\nrounds of quantitation.\n\n\nIMMUNOFLUORESCENCE STAINING OF TISSUES\n\nThe FFPE-embedded heart tissue samples were sectioned at 6 µm thickness and\nplaced on VWR Superfrost Plus Microscope slides. Deparaffinization was performed\nin xylene (twice for 10 min), followed by graded washes in 100% ethanol (twice\nfor 10 min), 95% ethanol for 5 min, 70% ethanol for 5 min, 50% ethanol for\n5 min, and incubated in deionized water for rehydration. Antigen retrieval was\nperformed using a proteinase K kit (Abcam ab64220) for 5 min at room\ntemperature. Following antigen retrieval, sections were permeabilized and\nblocked in 0.1 M Tris containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), 1% normal mouse\nserum, 1% normal goat serum and 1% BSA (R&D Systems). Samples were stained for\n2 h at room temperature in a wet chamber with the appropriate antibodies, washed\nthree times in PBS and mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Images were\nacquired using a TCS SP8 (Leica) inverted confocal microscope with a ×40/1.1 NA\nwater objective. Raw imaging data were processed using Imaris (Bitplane). The\nantibody information is provided in Supplementary Table 10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM12].\n\nFor node and glial cell staining of fresh-frozen heart tissue, 10 µm sections\nwere cut on to Superfrost plus slides and stored at −80 °C. These were thawed\nfor 10 min at room temperature, briefly rehydrated in TBS and fixed with room\ntemperature 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. Slides were then immersed for 10 min\nin TBS, and a hydrophobic pen was used to delimit the area of staining before\nstarting the permeabilization process (0.25% saponin in TBS for 10 min).\nBlocking buffer (0.3 M glycine in antibody dilution buffer) was applied for 1 h\nat room temperature, followed by an overnight incubation with primary antibody\nat 4 °C in a humidified chamber. The primary antibodies used were mouse\nanti-HCN1 (Abcam, ab84816) at 1:100 dilution and rabbit anti-PLP1 (Abcam\nab254363) at 1:500 in 10% normal goat serum in 0.2% Tween-20 and TBS. The\nisotype controls were Abcam ab37355 and ab172730. Slides were washed three times\n(5 min each) in 0.2% Tween-20 and TBS with gentle shaking, then secondary\nantibody solution was applied for 1 h at room temperature in the dark (1:1,000\ngoat anti-rabbit IgG AF555, LifeTech A21428 and 1:1,000 goat anti-mouse IgG\nAF647Plus, Fisher 15627898). Slides were washed three times (5 min each) in 0.2%\nTween-20 and TBS, incubated with DAPI for 15 min at room temperature in the dark\n(Invitrogen D1306, 5 mg ml–1 stock then diluted 1:50,000), washed again briefly\nand mounted with ProLong gold antifade mountant (Thermo Fisher). Slides were\nscanned at ×40 magnification on a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S60, and ROIs were imaged\non a Leica SP8 confocal at ×20 magnification. The antibody information is\nprovided in Supplementary Table 10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM12].\n\n\nREPORTING SUMMARY\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06311-1#MOESM2]\nlinked to this article.\n\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY\n\nOpen-access datasets are available from ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress\n[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress]) with accession numbers E-MTAB-12916\n[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-12916/] (multiome\nsnRNA-seq), E-MTAB-12919\n[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-12919/] (multiome\nsnATAC-seq) and E-MTAB-12975\n[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-12975/] (Visium).\nProcessed data of sc/snRNA-seq and Visium data are available for browsing gene\nexpression and download from the Heart Cell Atlas\n(https://www.heartcellatlas.org [https://www.heartcellatlas.org/]).

This was compared to a null\ndistribution of SNP proportion generated by 1000 random permutations of the true\nopen peaks.

        "content": "MAIN\n\nIt is estimated that 1 in 10 individuals—more than 30 million people in the\nUSA—have a diagnosis of a rare disease4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR4]. Although this term\nencompasses an estimated 7,000 different conditions, with a notable proportion\nhaving a known or presumed genetic aetiology, treatments are available for only\naround 5% of them4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR4],5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR5]. The rarity of\nthese conditions often makes it economically infeasible to develop treatments\nbased on traditional modalities. Previous work has shown that, in some cases,\nsplice-switching ASOs may restore functional protein levels and be administered\nin a safe and timely manner1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR1]. Such therapy\npresents a treatment opportunity; however, identifying individuals with genetic\nvariants suitable for such attempts remains a challenge1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR1],6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR6]. Here, we present a\nframework to systematically discover and develop splice-switching treatments for\nindividuals with rare diseases, using ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) as a model.\n\nA-T is an autosomal recessive disease caused by biallelic loss of function of\nATM, a gene involved in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR7]. Clinically, A-T is\ncharacterized by progressive cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency and\npredisposition to cancer, with early manifestations including ataxia,\ninvoluntary movements, neuropathy, oculomotor apraxia, dysphagia, slurred speech\nand ocular and skin telangiectasias3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR3]. The disease has a\nprevalence of 1 in 40,000 to 100,000 live births worldwide2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR2]. In ‘classical’ A-T\n(the most typical and prevalent clinical presentation), the average life\nexpectancy is 25 years, and early death is most frequently due to lung disease\nor cancer2 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR2].\nHypomorphic ATM variants can cause a milder, slower-progressing phenotype,\nalbeit still with severe morbidity8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR8].\n\nA-T is the most common form of inherited childhood progressive ataxia in many\ncountries9 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR9].\nNevertheless, effective therapies are lacking—particularly for the profound\nneurological manifestations that have a marked effect on quality of life. The\nlarge coding size (9.2 kb) of ATM poses a challenge for gene therapy approaches,\nas AAV vectors that are at present available have a packaging capacity of around\n4.7 kb (ref. 10 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR10]).\nThe protein product of ATM is an intracellular kinase, which makes enzyme\nreplacement approaches difficult. By contrast, A-T could be an appealing\ncandidate for splice-switching ASO therapy, given that ASOs readily distribute\nto the cerebellum when injected intrathecally11\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR11].\n\nThe Global A-T Family Data Platform is an international initiative led by family\nadvocates and primarily funded by A-T Children’s Project (ATCP), a\npatient-advocacy foundation for A-T. ATCP has systematically collected clinical\ninformation and genomic DNA (gDNA) from individuals who have been clinically or\ngenetically diagnosed with A-T. Through this effort, whole-genome sequencing\n(WGS) was performed, yielding a WGS dataset of 235 individuals with A-T. We\nanalysed this ‘ATCP cohort’ to establish molecular diagnoses, identify\npathogenic variants that could be amenable to splice-switching ASO therapy,\ndevelop proof-of-concept individualized ASOs and initiate a pilot\ninvestigational trial.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND DIAGNOSTIC YIELD\n\nThe ATCP cohort comprised de-identified phenotypic and genomic data from 235\nindividuals who were clinically or genetically diagnosed with A-T, from 209\nfamilies. Of these individuals, 46% were female (108/235) and the median age of\nclinical A-T diagnosis was 3.6 years (range 0–32; Extended Data Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Tab1] and Supplementary\nTable 1 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]).\n\nThe results of molecular genetic testing were available for only a small subset\nof individuals within the cohort (23%, 55/235), mostly from sequencing of ATM\ncoding regions (Fig. 1a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig1] and Extended Data\nTable 1 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Tab1]). We therefore\nperformed an extensive set of WGS analyses on all individuals to generate a\ncomprehensive picture of genetic variation in A-T. We identified\nsingle-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short indels using GATK12\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR12] (Supplementary\nTable 2 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]), VarScan213\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR13] and Strelka214\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR14]; and copy number\nvariants (CNVs), structural variants (SVs) and mobile DNA element insertions\nusing Delly15 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR15],\nPindel16 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR16], MELT17\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR17] and xTea18\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR18] (Supplementary\nTable 3 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]). For\ncompleteness, we manually inspected sequencing reads across the ATM locus using\nthe Integrative Genomics Viewer to identify variants that might have been missed\nby the aforementioned methods. Variants were named with respect to the\nGRCh38/hg38 reference genome and NM_000051.3, the canonical RefSeq transcript\nfor ATM.\n\nFig. 1: ATM disease candidate variants.\nfigure 1\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06277-0/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6277_Fig1_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/1\n\na, Diagnostic (left; green) and ASO therapeutic (right; blue) yields of clinical\ngenetic testing, WES simulation and WGS analysis for the 235 patients in the\nATCP cohort. The WES simulation assumed complete recovery of all exonic variants\n± 20 bp. b, Positions of ATM disease candidate variants. All SNVs and short\nindels, as well as SVs that are fully contained in a single intron, are\ndepicted. Two variants for which a splice-switching ASO was developed (c.7865C>T\nand c.5763-1050A>G) in this study are indicated. Deletion variants that span a\nsplice junction were considered to be located at the junction (position 0).\nShort indels and SVs were considered to be located at the boundary of the\nvariant closest to a nearby splice junction. c, Types and ASO amenability of all\ndisease candidate variants present in the cohort. d, Cumulative fraction and box\nplot distribution of the age at diagnosis, based on the possession of SDVs and a\nknown hypomorphic variant (c.5763-1050A>G). The P values (shown in the figure)\nwere calculated through the log-rank test using the survminer R package, and\nwere adjusted by the Bonferroni correction. Shaded areas, fraction ± 95%\nconfidence interval. For the box plots: centre, median; lower hinge, 25th\npercentile; upper hinge, 75th percentile; lower whisker, smallest value greater\nthan or equal to lower hinge − 1.5 × interquartile range (IQR); upper whisker,\nlargest value less than or equal to upper hinge + 1.5 × IQR.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/1]\n\nWe assessed the pathogenicity of variants using coding and splice impact\npredictions, population allele frequency (gnomAD and TOPMed) and experimental\nevidence (Supplementary Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]; for details,\nsee Methods [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Sec9]). Variants\nthat we considered to be disease-causing were referred to as ‘disease candidate’\nvariants. We noted that some of the disease candidate variants had been formally\nclassified as variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) by American College of\nMedical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines19\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR19]. These were\nconsidered disease-causing for the purpose of this analysis if (1) there was\nstrong support from computational predictions as disrupting gene function (for\nexample, SpliceAI20\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR20] or REVEL21\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR21] for splicing and\ncoding impact predictions, respectively); and (2) no other variants were\nidentified by WGS that could account for the clinical diagnosis (Supplementary\nNote 1 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). Similarly,\nsome coding CNVs were considered disease candidate variants even when officially\nclassified as VUSs by ACMG guidelines. Use of such a broader definition of\npathogenicity is not unprecedented in WGS studies22\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR22], in which a\nnear-complete landscape of mutational events for a given individual can be\ncharacterized. Such VUSs constituted a relatively small proportion of the\ndisease candidate variants (22 of 220 unique variants; 27 of 469 total\nmutational events).\n\nAt least 2 disease candidate ATM variants were identified in 232 out of 235\nindividuals (98.7%; Fig. 1a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig1] and Supplementary\nTable 1 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]). Two of the\nother three individuals had one disease candidate variant and a VUS that we\nconsidered to have plausible biological impact, but were not confident enough to\nclassify as a disease candidate variant (Extended Data Fig. 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig6] and Supplementary\nNote 2 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). In the\nremaining case, only one heterozygous disease candidate variant was found (that\nis, a second pathogenic event was not found). We also noted that in 3 out of 235\ncases, our WGS analyses resulted in a revision of previously reported genetic\ntesting results (Supplementary Note 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]).\n\nTo confirm the fidelity of our variant calls, gDNA samples were obtained from 16\npatients. Sanger sequencing validated all tested variant calls in these samples\n(31/31 mutational events; Supplementary Tables 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4] and 5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). We were also able\nto use experimental or in silico approaches to analyse variant phasing in 88\npatients (from 78 families): (1) trio Sanger sequencing was performed for 5\ncases for which gDNA samples were available (Supplementary Tables 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4] and 6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]); (2) for two cases,\nread-based phasing was performed by using WhatsHap23\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR23]; (3) for 47 cases,\nanalyses of variant co-occurrence in gnomAD strongly predicted that the 2\nobserved variants were in trans; (4) 32 cases involved homozygous ATM variants;\nand (5) for 5 cases, a variant appeared homozygous because it was in trans to a\ndeletion. In aggregate, these analyses confirmed that 88 cases (from 78\nfamilies) have disease candidate variants on both alleles (Supplementary Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]; for more details on\nphasing, see Methods).\n\nWe simulated the diagnostic yield of an exon-targeted sequencing approach if\nperformed in lieu of WGS. Perfect coverage of all exonic variants ± 20\nnucleotides from flanking regions would have established a molecular diagnosis\nin 207 of 235 individuals (a diagnostic yield of 88.1%, compared to 98.7%\nachieved with comprehensive WGS analyses; Fig. 1a,b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig1]).\n\n\nDISEASE CANDIDATE VARIANTS\n\nWe identified 469 disease candidate ATM mutational events in 235 patients. These\ncomprised a total of 220 unique ATM variants, ranging from SNVs to short indels\nand SVs. A substantial fraction of these events (75%, 353/469) were predicted to\nconfer strong loss of function, including frameshift variants (31%, 145/469),\nstop-gain or start-loss variants (22%, 104/469), splice-site-destroying variants\n(16%, 75/469; defined on the basis of SpliceAI20\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR20] and MaxEntScan24\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR24] predictions; for\ndetails, see Methods [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Sec9])\nand missense variants or short in-frame indels with previous experimental\nevidence of complete loss of ATM kinase activity (29/469, 6.2%; Fig. 1c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig1] and Supplementary\nTable 7 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]).\n\nSVs that severely disrupt the open reading frame of ATM (out-of-frame inversions\nor deletions; inversions or deletions involving the start or stop codon; or\nduplication of more than 10 middle coding exons) made up 5.8% (27/469) of all\ndisease candidate mutational events (Supplementary Table 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]). These included 26\ncopy number changes (23 deletions, 2 duplications and 1 complex rearrangement\n(combined inversion and deletion); Extended Data Fig. 2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig7] and Supplementary Fig.\n2 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]) and 1 copy\nnumber-neutral inversion event (involving the first 16 exons of ATM;\nSupplementary Fig. 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). Of the 23 deletion\nevents, 16 involved the last 2 exons of ATM (a region that includes the stop\ncodon and partially encodes the ATM kinase domain), present in 15 patients (1\npatient was homozygous for the deletion, hence 16 events in 15 patients).\n\nThe 27 SVs disrupting the open reading frame, together with the 353 additional\nstrong loss-of-function mutational events mentioned above (frameshift,\nstop-gain, start-loss, splice-site-destroying or missense variants with previous\nexperimental evidence of loss of function), are expected to lead to deficient\nand/or absent ATM protein expression or function (ATM null). This group, which\nwe refer to as ‘severely disruptive variants’ (SDVs), constitutes 81% (380/469)\nof the disease candidate mutational events encountered. More than half of the\nindividuals in this cohort (66%, 156/235) had two of these SDV events, which\nwould be expected to lead to the classical A-T phenotype with a more severe\nprognosis. Indeed, individuals with 2 SDV events leading to ATM null status\ntended to have an earlier clinical diagnosis compared to individuals with other\ngenotypes (79/235; P <  0.05, log-rank test), even after factoring out 13\npatients with a known hypomorphic variant (c.5763-1050A>G, prevalent in the UK)\nas one of the pathogenic variants (Fig. 1d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig1]).\n\nIn addition, we detected six insertion events (100 bp–4 kb) fully contained\nwithin introns. These included two pseudogene insertions (4 kb; one homozygous\npatient), one tandem duplication (382 bp; Supplementary Fig. 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]), and three Alu\nretrotransposon insertions (around 280 bp, one n = 1 event; around 131 bp, one\nn = 2 event). Although these intronic events do not directly disrupt the coding\nsequence (and therefore were not counted as SDVs), they could still contribute\nto loss of function by activating cryptic splice sites or disrupting canonical\nsplicing. For instance, the 382-bp tandem duplication was strongly predicted by\nSpliceAI20 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR20] to\ncause inclusion of an out-of-frame (256-bp) pseudoexon in intron 33, which would\nlead to premature translational termination and nonsense-mediated decay\n(Supplementary Fig. 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]).\n\nEvidence supporting the remaining 83 disease candidate variants (mostly missense\nand intronic and synonymous variants) was obtained from previous interpretations\nin ClinVar, their rarity and/or other predictions of functional impact (for\ndetails of the procedure for determining disease candidate variants, see Methods\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Sec9]; for the overlap\nbetween disease candidate variants and ClinVar variants, see Extended Data Fig.\n3a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig8]).\n\nOf the variants encountered, 64% (141/220) were singletons (that is, appeared\nonly once in this cohort). The remaining 36% (79/220) were observed at least\ntwice. The most highly recurrent variant was c.5932G>T (p.Glu1978Ter), present\nin 16 individuals (Extended Data Fig. 3b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig8] and Supplementary\nTable 8 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]).\n\n\nASO-AMENABLE VARIANTS\n\nWe developed a taxonomy to classify disease-causing variants on the basis of\ntheir predicted amenability to splice-switching ASO intervention, using\ncategories of ‘probably’, ‘possibly’ or ‘unlikely’ (further details of the\ntaxonomy are provided in Fig. 2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig2] and Methods). In\nbrief, the taxonomy addresses two questions:\n\n(1) Does the variant directly damage the coding function and/or a canonical\nsplice site? If yes, by how much? Damage to the coding function was assessed by\nusing in silico predictor (REVEL21\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR21]) and experimental\nevidence from the literature; damage to canonical splicing function was assessed\nby using SpliceAI20\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR20], MaxEntScan24\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR24] and LaBranchoR25\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR25].\n\n(2) Does the variant lead to a type of mis-splicing that might be rescued by an\nASO? Mis-splicing events can be induced when a variant creates a novel splice\nsite or weakens exon definition (through disruption of canonical donor–acceptor\nsites or splicing enhancers, or creation of splicing silencers). Of the two\ntypes, a gain of a splice site is more amenable to rescue than a weakening of\nexon definition, because repressing a cryptic splice site can often be achieved\nby simply blocking the site with an ASO, whereas promoting a weakened exon\nrequires identifying and blocking silencer elements within or near the exon.\nThese possibilities were assessed with in silico splicing predictions based on\nSpliceAI and MaxEntScan, as well as experimental evidence.\n\nFig. 2: Taxonomy of ASO-amenable variants.\nfigure 2\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06277-0/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6277_Fig2_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/2\n\nTwo-step logic for classifying the amenability of genetic variants to splice\nmodulation rescue (probably, possibly or unlikely). First, each variant is\nevaluated for its damaging impact on either canonical splicing or protein-coding\nfunction, on the basis of SpliceAI, MaxEntScan, LaBranchoR and REVEL. Second,\neach variant is evaluated for potential mis-splicing impact: gain of a splice\nsite, exon skipping or intron retention. See Methods for complete details.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/2]\n\nUsing this taxonomy, we encountered 36 probably/possibly ASO-amenable mutational\nevents (representing 17 unique variants) in 35 patients from the ATCP cohort\n(15%, 35/235; Fig. 1a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig1]\nand Supplementary Table 9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]). Specifically, 22\nindividuals (9%, 22/235) had at least one probably amenable variant (Fig. 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig3]), and 13 (6%, 13/235)\nhad a possibly amenable variant (Extended Data Fig. 4a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig9]). Four of the 17\nprobably/possibly amenable variants were found in more than a single patient,\nwith the most highly recurrent variant (c.5763-1050A>G) present in 13 of the 235\npatients. Only 22% (8/36) of the ASO-amenable variants had been previously\nclassified in ClinVar as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (Extended Data Fig. 3a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig8]); 50% (18/36) had been\npreviously classified as likely benign, uncertain significance or conflicting\ninterpretations of pathogenicity; and 28% (10/36) were not reported in ClinVar\n(as opposed to around 17% for non-ASO-amenable variants). These findings suggest\nthat ASO-amenable variants are often misinterpreted and underrepresented in\nClinVar.\n\nFig. 3: Probably ASO-amenable variants.\nfigure 3\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06277-0/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6277_Fig3_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/3\n\nCases indicates the number of individuals with the variant in the ATCP cohort of\n235 individuals. The homozygous DUSP16 pseudogene insertion event (Supplementary\nTable 3 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]) is not\nshown. For the full list of probably ASO-amenable variants, see Supplementary\nTable 9 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]. SRE,\nsplicing regulatory element; ΔMES, change in MaxEntScan score when a given\nvariant is introduced.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/3]\n\nThe majority (26/36, 72%) of the probably/possibly ASO-amenable mutational\nevents were deep intronic, defined as being located more than 20 nucleotides\naway from an exon (Fig. 1b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig1]). These included six\nSV events that were fully contained in an intron (Supplementary Fig. 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3] and Supplementary\nTables 3 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4] and 9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]). Restricting the\nanalysis to exons and the flanking intronic regions (20 or more nucleotides from\nsplice junctions), the yield of ASO-amenable variants was only 4% (1%, probably;\n3%, possibly). Hence, WGS (9%, probably; 6%, possibly) provides a 3.5-fold\n(counting all amenable variants; 35 cases versus 10 cases) to 7-fold (counting\nonly probably amenable variants; 22 cases vs. 3 cases) higher ‘ASO therapeutic\nyield’ than whole-exome sequencing (WES; Fig. 1a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig1]).\n\nWe used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or experimental minigene splicing assays to\nbenchmark the accuracy of our predictions. For two probably ASO-amenable\nvariants (c.7865C>T, c.5763-1050A>G), patient fibroblasts were available for\nRNA-seq; for nine additional probably/possibly ASO-amenable variants, gDNA\nsamples were available, and experimental minigene splicing assays were\nsuccessfully established (for more details about minigene assays, see Methods\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Sec9] and Supplementary\nTables 10 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]–12\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]). All tested\nvariants (11/11) yielded the predicted mis-splicing consequences (for RNA-seq,\nsee the following sections; for minigene assays, see Extended Data Fig. 5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig10]). Furthermore, we\nconducted ASO screens for six probably ASO-amenable variants (two based on\npatient fibroblasts and four based on minigene assays), and successfully\nidentified ASOs capable of correcting mis-splicing for all six (see the\nfollowing sections for patient-fibroblast-based screens, Fig. 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig4] for minigene-based\nscreens and Supplementary Table 9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4] for a summary).\n\nFig. 4: Validation of ASO amenability.\nfigure 4\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06277-0/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6277_Fig4_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/4\n\na–c, For four probably ASO-amenable variants for which a minigene-based splicing\nassay is robustly established (a, c.2839-579_2839-576del (GGTAA>G) and\nc.2839-581G>A; b, c.6348-986G>T; and c, c.3994-159A>G), small-scale ASO\nscreening was performed, which showed that the mis-splicing events caused by all\ntested variants can be rescued by ASOs.

For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM1].\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/4]\n\nOverall, four ASO-amenable variants were recurrent within the cohort:\nc.5763-1050A>G, c.2250G>A, chr11:108243936-108243949insAlu and\nc.2639-22_2639-20del were found in thirteen, five, two and two individuals,\nrespectively (Supplementary Table 9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]). In addition,\nseveral different ASO-amenable variants had splicing consequences that appeared\naddressable with a single ASO; for instance, both c.2839-579_2839-576del and\nc.2839-581G>A result in the inclusion of the same pseudoexon (Fig. 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig3]). We therefore\nsubdivided variants into ‘treatment groups’, each potentially addressable with a\nsingle ASO drug. On the basis of these patterns, around 70% (24/35) of amenable\nindividuals were predicted to be treatable with a total of five different\nsplice-switching ASOs, whereas developing splice-switching treatments for all 35\nindividuals would require 15 distinct therapeutic ASO drugs (Extended Data Fig.\n4b [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig9] and Supplementary\nTable 9 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]).\n\n\nSELECTION OF VARIANTS FOR ASO DEVELOPMENT\n\nTwo ASO-amenable ATM variants were selected for further development. The first\nwas c.5763-1050A>G (Fig. 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig3]). The variant, located\ndeep in intron 38, results in the inclusion of a 137-bp pseudoexon, thereby\ncausing a frameshift in the resulting mature product26\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR26]. This variant is\nassociated with a mild A-T phenotype owing to partial leakiness of its\ngain-of-splicing effect. It is a founder variant in the UK, with an estimated\ndisease allele frequency of 18% in individuals with A-T in the UK (refs. 27\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR27],28\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR28]). In the ATCP\ncohort, composed predominantly of individuals from the USA, it was found in a\ncompound heterozygous state in 13 unrelated patients, representing a population\nfrequency of 5.5% (13/235) and a disease allele frequency of 2.8% (13/469).\n\nThe second variant was c.7865C>T (Fig. 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig3]). This variant has\nbeen previously identified in the homozygous state in patients with classical\n(severe) A-T. A lymphoblastoid cell line with this variant had no residual\nprotein or enzymatic activity29\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR29] (A. M. R. Taylor,\npersonal communication); that is, this variant is a null variant. This variant\nis predicted to have a benign coding effect (p.Ala2622Val; predicted benign by\nREVEL), with a pathogenic effect that is mediated by mis-splicing: it creates a\nstrong splice donor site within exon 53 (of 63 exons), causing truncation of the\nexon by 64 bp, which results in frameshift and subsequent premature\ntranslational termination. Inhibition of this splice donor site with a\nmorpholino oligonucleotide has been previously shown to rescue the cellular\nphenotype of a patient-derived cell line30\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR30].\n\nc.7865C>T was encountered in one individual in the ATCP cohort (DDP_ATCP_520,\ncurrently 20 years old). Separately, we also identified a second, younger (one\nyear old at referral; currently six years old) child with A-T with this variant\nas well (Extended Data Fig. 6a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig11] and Supplementary\nNote 4 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). Whereas\nmost patients with A-T are diagnosed after the initial onset of symptoms\n(Supplementary Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]), this child was\ndiagnosed as an infant on the basis of an abnormally low T cell receptor\nexcision circle (TREC) count. TREC assays are used in newborn screening to\nidentify infants at risk for severe combined immune deficiency (SCID), but have\nalso incidentally identified cases of A-T (ref. 31\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR31]). Exome sequencing\nin this child showed compound heterozygosity for two ATM variants: c.7865C>T and\nc.8585-13_8598del (confirmed by trio Sanger sequencing; Supplementary Table 6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). The latter is a\n27-bp deletion at the intron–exon junction of exon 59, strongly predicted to\ncause complete loss of function (Supplementary Note 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). This combination\nof variants predicted a classical, early-onset A-T phenotype (Fig. 1d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig1]).\n\n\nCORRECTING C.7865C>T AND C.5763-1050A>G\n\nA fibroblast cell line was established from the younger patient with c.7865C>T.\nPCR with reverse transcription (RT–PCR) and RNA-seq analysis of splicing\npatterns in this cell line showed an abnormal truncation of exon 53 owing to\npremature splice donor site usage, consistent with previous studies30\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR30] (Extended Data\nFig. 6b,c [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig11]). Analysis\nusing allele-specific PCR primers (designed to exclude the non-target\nc.8585-13_8598del allele) showed that ATM mis-splicing by c.7865C>T is complete,\nwithout detectable leakiness (Extended Data Fig. 6d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig11]).\n\nTo attempt to correct the mis-splicing, we designed an initial set of 12 ASOs,\ntargeting either the novel splice donor site in the exon (AT001-AT011; Fig. 5a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig5] and Supplementary\nTable 13 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]) or a\nnearby predicted splice regulatory element (AT012; Extended Data Fig. 7a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig12]). Several of these\nASOs were effective in restoring normal splicing on allele-specific RT–PCR in\npatient fibroblasts (Supplementary Table 14\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]), with two designs\n(AT007 and AT008) showing the most promise. Both ASOs were 22 nt long and were\noffset only by 3 nt, revealing an efficacy hotspot. A set of 20 additional ASOs\nwas designed against this region and tested for the mis-splicing rescue in a\nsecondary screen (Extended Data Fig. 7b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig12]), revealing\nadditional ASOs with an efficacy similar to that of AT008.\n\nFig. 5: Preclinical development of AT008 (atipeksen).\nfigure 5\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06277-0/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6277_Fig5_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/5\n\na, Design and screening of ASOs targeting c.7865C>T.

Immunoblotting\nexperiments using antibodies against phospho-P53 and phospho-KAP1 showed\nASO-mediated rescue of radiation-induced ATM signalling in patient cell lines\n(Fig. 5b [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig5] and Extended\nData Fig. 8a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig13]).\nPartial retention of ATM kinase activity has been shown to be associated with\nincreased median age of diagnosis and age of death, and later onset of\nneurological symptoms33\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR33]. In particular,\nafter ASO treatment, the levels of phospho-P53 and phospho-KAP1 exceeded those\nmeasured in fibroblasts bearing the hypomorphic c.5763-1050A>G variant,\nsupporting the potential clinical relevance of this rescue.\n\nAT008 (22 nt) and AT026 (20 nt) were selected for additional characterization.\nBoth ASOs were capable of rescuing radiation-induced P53 and KAP1 activation by\nimmunocytochemistry (Fig. 5c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig5] and Extended Data Fig.\n8b [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig13]), confirming the\nprevious immunoblot results. Dose–response analysis showed that AT008 and AT026\nhad half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) and half-maximum inhibitory\nconcentration (IC50) values in the nanomolar range (Extended Data Fig. 8c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig13]), consistent with\npreviously reported ASOs for clinical use1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR1], but AT008 was\nthree times more potent than AT026. AT008 also showed substantially greater\nsuppression of abnormal splicing compared to AT026 in RNA-seq experiments from\ntreated patient fibroblasts (52% versus 28% correction for AT008 versus AT026,\nversus 0–6% in controls; Extended Data Fig. 8d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig13]). Both ASOs were also\nfound to have the undesirable effect of increasing exon 53 skipping (although we\nnoted that ASOs that target intronic splicing silencers could potentially avoid\nexon skipping, AT012, designed to explore this strategy, did not show any\npromising activity; Extended Data Fig. 7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig12]). Nevertheless, even\nadjusting for this undesirable effect, AT008 and AT026 boosted the levels of\nfunctional ATM transcript from 0–5% (untreated patient fibroblasts) to 29%\n(AT008) and 18% (AT026), in addition to restoring P53 and KAP1 phosphorylation\nas described above. In silico analyses showed that AT008 and AT026 had clean\noff-target profiles in the human genome (no binding sites within exons, or\nwithin introns up to 5 kb from the nearest exon, allowing end-trimming of up to\n6 nt and internal mismatches of up to 2 nt; Supplementary Figs. 5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3] and 6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). These off-target\nprofiles compared favourably with nusinersen and milasen, two clinically\nadministered intrathecal ASOs (Supplementary Figs. 7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3] and 8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). In vitro cellular\ntoxicity assays showed that AT008 is as tolerable as a non-targeting control ASO\n(Supplementary Fig. 9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]).\n\nParallel experiments were performed for the c.5763-1050A>G variant. A fibroblast\ncell line was established from a patient with A-T from the ATCP cohort\n(DDP_ATCP_42) and used to confirm the mis-splicing consequences of\nc.5763-1050A>G (Fig. 3 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig3]\nand Extended Data Fig. 9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig14]). ASOs were designed\nto block the pseudoexon usage associated with this allele, and screening in\npatient fibroblasts successfully identified a lead ASO that was capable of\nrescuing ATM function (Extended Data Figs. 10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig15] and 11\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig16], Supplementary Note 5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3] and Supplementary\nFigs. 9 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3] and 11\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]).\n\n\nINDIVIDUALIZED TRIAL FOR ATM C.7865C>T\n\nThe c.7865C>T-targeting ASO AT008 (renamed atipeksen) was selected for further\nclinical development. It was chosen because of the association of c.7865C>T with\nsevere disease (classical A-T), the robustness of atipeksen-mediated RNA and\ncellular functional rescue and the opportunity for early therapeutic\nintervention before the onset of major neurological morbidity in the previously\nidentified young child with this variant. (Note that the other identified\nindividual with this variant, DDP_ATCP_520, was not considered to be a suitable\ncandidate for clinical intervention owing to the advanced stage of the disease).\n\nFollowing appropriate good manufacturing practice (GMP) and animal safety\nstudies (previously described1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR1]), and in accordance\nwith draft guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA;\nFDA-2020-D-2199, FDA-2021-D-0320, FDA-2021-D-1139 and FDA-2021-D-1140), the\nchild was enrolled in an expanded access trial to determine whether atipeksen\nmight prevent or slow disease progression. Intrathecal injection was chosen\nrather than intracerebroventricular injection after considering safety,\npharmacokinetics and biodistribution, as outlined in Supplementary Note 8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]. Dosing was\ninitiated at the age of two, with careful exploratory dose escalation followed\nby a maintenance regimen of 42 mg every three months (for dosing and assessments\nschedules, pharmacokinetic measurements, exploratory disease biomarkers and dose\njustification simulations, see Extended Data Fig. 12\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig17] and Supplementary\nFig. 12 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). This is\nanticipated to be a multi-year trial, given that the most notable neurological\ndecline in classic A-T occurs between the ages of 5 and 10 (refs. 34\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR34],35\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR35],36\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR36]; at present, the\npatient is six years old). Investigational treatment has been well tolerated for\nthree years so far with some encouraging signs (Supplementary Note 6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nASOs exemplify a class of therapeutic agents suitable for developing\nvariant-targeted therapies, including those applicable to as few individuals as\na single patient1 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR1].\nAlbeit promising, these opportunities also present challenges1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR1],6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR6]. Our results begin\nto shed light on the generalizability and scalability of using ASOs to\nameliorate the effect of splice-switching genetic variants.\n\nIn our cohort, we found that 9% of individuals with A-T had at least one variant\nprobably amenable to intervention with splice-switching ASOs, and an additional\n6% had possibly ASO-amenable variants, totalling 15% of the cohort. Notably,\nreaching this fraction required the use of WGS, as most splice-switching\nASO-amenable variants (72%, 26/36) were located within deep intronic regions\nthat would have been missed by exon-based sequencing. Furthermore, a substantial\nfraction of the ASO-amenable intronic variants (23%, 6/26) were not SNVs or\nshort indels but rather SVs or mobile DNA element insertions, highlighting the\nneed for comprehensive variant analytics. We note that upfront screening with\nRNA-seq in addition to WGS could be of additional benefit37\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR37] but could present\nsome complexities (for example, logistical challenges collecting high-quality\nRNA samples) or other limitations (for example, the inability to assess genes\nnot expressed in accessible tissues). Certainly, RNA-seq as a follow-up test is\ncrucial for variants flagged as being potentially ASO-amenable.\n\nThese results provide a useful first estimate (9–15%) of the prevalence of this\nclass of variants with potential therapeutic implications in the recessive\ngenetic disorder A-T. Through a meta-analysis of published literature38\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR38],39\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR39], we also found\nthat individuals with inherited retinal disease caused by recessive ABCA4\ndeficiency (Stargardt disease or cone rod dystrophy) are likely to have\nASO-amenable variants in similar proportions (Supplementary Note 7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3] and Supplementary\nTables 15 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4] and 16\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]), leading us to\nsuggest that around 15% is a reasonable first estimate for other recessive\ngenetic conditions. Of course, conditions with unusual genetic architecture,\nsuch as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), will pose exceptions: although SMA is\ncaused by recessive variants in SMN1, all individuals with SMA can be treated\nvia ASO- or small-molecule-mediated splice modulation40\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR40],41\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR41] because all\npatients also have an evolutionarily acquired, pathogenic splice ‘variant’ in\nSMN2, a gene that can substitute for SMN1. Another example is familial\ndysautonomia, in which almost all cases are associated with a founder variant\nthat causes a tissue-specific splicing defect42\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR42] and may be\namenable to splice modulation rescue43\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR43]. With respect to\ndominant loss-of-function conditions, because these are associated with one\npathogenic variant per individual, not two, one can expect the prevalence of\nsplice-switching ASO-amenable variants to be roughly half (that is, about 5–8%).\n\nWithin the cohort of 235 individuals with A-T, we identified 35 individuals with\nASO-amenable variants, and successfully conducted small-scale ASO screening for\nseveral probably amenable variants. ASOs successfully rescued mis-splicing for\neach of the tested variants, providing evidence of the utility of our predictive\ntaxonomy. Splice-switching ASOs that are capable of rescuing functional ATM\ndeficits in patient cell lines were successfully developed for two recurrent ATM\nvariants. One of these is being tested in a pilot first-in-human investigational\ntrial, which has been underway for the past 36 months.\n\nWe note that it might be possible to treat around 70% of these individuals with\nas few as 5 splice-switching ASOs, whereas treating all 35 individuals would\nrequire 15 distinct drugs (Extended Data Fig. 4b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig9]). This illustrates\nboth the opportunities and the challenges of developing individualized\nsplice-switching ASOs under a traditional ‘one-drug-at-a-time’ model. These\nopportunities and challenges will apply to other variant-specific treatment\nstrategies (for instance, CRISPR editing), underscoring the need for innovative,\nplatform-based scientific and regulatory approaches to unlock their potential.\n\nOverall, our study provides a framework for how individualized genetic therapy\nmight work, using genome sequencing and analysis to efficiently identify\nvariants that might be amenable to splice-switching intervention, in time to\ndesign, test and deploy an appropriate ASO. If successful, these approaches\ncould someday encourage a re-evaluation of which genetic findings are considered\n‘actionable’. However, it is worth emphasizing that this approach at present\nremains investigational, and contains uncertainty and risk that have to be\nweighed carefully in a clinical context. Key logistical, regulatory, economic\nand ethical considerations remain as well1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR1],6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR6],44\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR44],45\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR45] (FDA draft\nguidance: FDA-2020-D-2199, FDA-2021-D-0320, FDA-2021-D-1139 and\nFDA-2021-D-1140). Continued study of patient-customized ASO therapies in serious\ngenetic illness, facilitated by this framework, will be important to gather the\nbody of evidence necessary to support the viability of this approach.\n\n\nMETHODS\n\n\nPATIENTS\n\nThe WGS and clinical data of 235 patients with A-T were provided by the Global\nA-T Family Data Platform of ATCP. Our access to the data was approved by the\nData Access Committee of ATCP.\n\nSelected patients with A-T enrolled at the Manton Center for Orphan Disease\nResearch under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Boston\nChildren’s Hospital (10-02-0053). These included the individual with c.7865C>T\nwho has been treated with AT008 (atipeksen), and individuals in the ATCP cohort,\nwho were enrolled for WGS variant call validation by Sanger sequencing and\nmis-splicing validation by minigene assay and RNA-seq. gDNA samples extracted\nfrom the saliva of patients were provided by the Broad Institute. Whole-blood\nsamples were provided by their physicians through the ATCP foundation, and RNA\nsamples were extracted from these.\n\nFunctional studies using the cells derived from patients and their families were\nperformed after obtaining appropriate consent under the auspices of an\nIRB-approved protocol maintained by the Manton Center for Orphan Disease\nResearch Gene Discovery Core at Boston Children’s Hospital. Skin fibroblasts\nwere derived from a 2-mm punch biopsy taken from the patient’s skin using\nexplant culture. Fibroblasts were maintained and passaged in medium containing\nDMEM (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco).\nFibroblasts used in experiments were under passage 20.\n\n\nVARIANT CALLING\n\nWGS reads were aligned to GRCh38/hg38 using BWA (v.0.7.17) (ref. 46\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR46]) and\npre-processing and quality control were performed according to GATK Best\nPractice Workflows12\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR12]. Multiple\ncomputational tools were used to call diverse types of variants, including\nGATK-HaplotypeCaller (v.3.5) (ref. 12\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR12]), VarScan2\n(v.2.4.4) (ref. 13\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR13]) and Strelka2\n(v.2.9.10) (ref. 14\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR14]) for SNVs and\nshort indels (less than 50 nt in length; Supplementary Table 2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]) and Delly (v.0.8.6)\n(ref. 15 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR15]), Pindel\n(v.0.2.5b8) (ref. 16\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR16]), MELT (v.2.2.2)\n(ref. 17 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR17]), and\nxTea (v.0.1.7)18 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR18]\nfor SVs (50 or more nt in length; Supplementary Table 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]), with MELT and xTea\nused specifically for transposons. For large CNVs with imprecise boundaries, we\nmanually inspected read alignments on Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV; v.2.8.9)\n(ref. 47 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR47]) to\ndetermine rough boundaries of the variants.\n\n\nRELATEDNESS\n\nTo analyse relatedness among the 235 individuals in the ATCP cohort, we used\nVCFtools (v.0.1.17) with the ‘relatedness2’ option48\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR48] (Supplementary\nTable 1 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]), which is\nbased on the KING software package49\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR49]. For individuals\nwith the annotated relatedness information in the clinical record, all\nannotations were consistent with the inferred relatedness.\n\n\nVARIANT EFFECT PREDICTION\n\nFor variant effect prediction, VEP (release 100)50\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR50] was used to\nannotate all SNVs and short indels. Protein-coding impact was evaluated using\nREVEL21 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR21] and\nexperimental evidence of protein functionality in the literature (Supplementary\nTable 7 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]);\nmis-splicing impact was evaluated using MaxEntScan24\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR24], SpliceAI20\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR20] and LaBranchoR25\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR25].\nLaBranchoR-predicted branchpoint coordinates on GRCh37/hg19 were downloaded.\nAfter converting them to the GRCh38/hg38 coordinates (using LiftOver), their\npotential overlap and distance to variants were examined. For variants shorter\nthan 50 nucleotides, the allele frequencies were looked up in gnomAD (v.3.1)\n(ref. 51 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR51]) and\nTOPMed (freeze 8; ref. 52\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR52]). For SVs, the\nallele frequencies were looked up in dbVar53\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR53], DGV54\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR54] and gnomAD SVs\n(v.2.1) (ref. 55 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR55]).\nThe clinical significance of variants was looked up in ClinVar (as of 2 June\n2020; ref. 56 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR56]).\nAll disease candidate SV events were confirmed by manually inspecting the raw\nsequencing data on IGV.\n\n\nACMG CLASSIFICATION\n\nDisease candidate variants were classified using a five-tiered system in\naccordance with the guidelines outlined by ACMG19\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR19],57\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR57]. For predicted\nloss-of-function variants, we used specialized ACMG recommendations to apply the\nPVS1 criteria58 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR58].\nFor CNVs, we used a specialized scoring framework proposed by ACMG and Clinical\nGenome Resource (ClinGen)59\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR59].\n\n\nDETERMINATION OF DISEASE CANDIDATE VARIANTS\n\nFirst, we defined SDVs. These include frameshift, stop-gain, start-loss and\nsplice-site-destroying variants, and structural variants affecting one or more\nexons, as well as missense variants and short in-frame indels with previous\nexperimental evidence of functional loss. Splice-site-destroying variants were\ndefined as: (SpliceAI donor/acceptor loss score ≥ 0.1 at a canonical splice\nsite) AND (MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the ALT allele < MaxEntScan\ndonor/acceptor score with the REF allele) AND [(MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score\nwith the ALT allele < 2) OR (MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the ALT\nallele < 0.3 × MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the REF allele)]. All SDVs\nwere considered as disease candidate variants. Second, variants that were\nannotated as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in ClinVar were considered as\ndisease candidate variants.\n\nFor the patients in whom fewer than two disease candidate events were identified\nin the previous two steps, we analysed the remaining variants in each patient on\nthe basis of the population and cohort allele frequencies. We filtered out\nvariant calls whose population or cohort allele frequencies are higher than that\nof c.5932G>T (p.Glu1978Ter); this variant has the highest allele frequency in\nthis ATCP cohort among the variants annotated as pathogenic in ClinVar. It has\ngnomAD v.3.1 and ATCP cohort allele frequencies of 0.0000349045 and 0.034\n(16/470), respectively. For the variant calls that had passed the allele\nfrequency filter, their protein-coding and splicing impacts were examined on the\nbasis of multiple computational tools: REVEL (for protein-coding impacts) and\nSpliceAI and MaxEntScan (for splicing impacts). Missense variants that were\npredicted as pathogenic by REVEL (score ≥ 0.5) were considered as disease\ncandidate variants. Mis-splicing events with a SpliceAI score of 0.1 or higher\nwere considered as likely true events. If the consequence of the mis-splicing is\npredicted to result in frameshift or loss of a crucial domain of the protein,\nthe variant that caused the mis-splicing was classified as a disease candidate\nvariant. For the patients in whom fewer than two disease candidate events were\nidentified up to this step, we reviewed the remaining variants on a case-by-case\nbasis (Supplementary Note 2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]).\n\nSanger sequencing validation of a subset of disease candidate variants was\nperformed using available patient gDNA samples. The PCR protocol comprised 10 ng\ntemplate DNA, 10 µl KAPA2G Robust HotStart ReadyMix (2X; Kapa Biosystems), 1 µl\nsite-specific primer pairs (10 µM), and PCR-grade water to a final volume of\n20 µl. The cycling parameters were 94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s,\n60 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 15 s; 72 °C for 3 min; and held at 4 °C. Validation\nprimers are listed in Supplementary Table 4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]. All PCR amplicons\nwere visualized on 2% agarose gels. Variants and corresponding genotypes were\nconfirmed by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]).\n\n\nPHASING OF DISEASE CANDIDATE VARIANTS\n\nTRIO SANGER SEQUENCING\n\nTrio Sanger sequencing was performed on the family of the patient (with\nc.7865C>T) who has been under treatment with atipeksen, as well as on five\nindividuals in the ATCP cohort (four families; DDP_ATCP_42 (with\nc.5763-1050A>G), DDP_ATCP_218, DDP_ATCP_38/39, DDP_ATCP_96). In all six cases,\nwe confirmed with Sanger sequencing that the two disease candidate variants in\neach case are in trans (Supplementary Tables 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4] and 6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]).\n\nHOMOZYGOSITY\n\nIn 32 cases (32 families), disease candidate variants were found to be\nhomozygous. In five other cases (five families), disease candidate variants\nappeared homozygous owing to being in trans with a deletion at a locus\noverlapping the variants (Supplementary Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]).\n\nREAD-BASED PHASING\n\nWhen the distance between two disease candidate variants is shorter than the\nread length, the two variants can be phased using read-based phasing methods. We\nused WhatsHap (v.1.0) (ref. 23\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR23]), a read-based\nphasing tool, to analyse such cases, and found that in two cases (one family),\nthe two disease candidate variants were in trans. These two variants were only\n62 bp apart and were also confirmed by manual inspection of the raw sequencing\ndata on IGV (Supplementary Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]).\n\nVARIANT CO-OCCURRENCE\n\nThe gnomAD variant co-occurrence database can be used to predict that the two\nvariants are likely to be in cis or in trans60\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR60]. If two variants\nare in the same haplotype (that is, in cis), they tend to appear in the same\nindividual. This analysis could be performed only for individuals whose two\ndisease candidate variants are represented in the gnomAD database (v.2.1.1, in\nGRCh37/hg19 coordinates) at a global allele frequency of higher than 0% and less\nthan 5%. A total of 47 individuals (38 families) in the ATCP cohort met these\ncriteria. The analysis showed that 2 disease candidate variants are highly\nlikely to be on different haplotypes in all of the 47 individuals (Supplementary\nTable 1 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]).\n\n\nASO AMENABILITY TAXONOMY\n\nGENERAL RULES\n\n(1) If a variant damages both a canonical splice site and protein-coding\nfunction at the same time, more severe damage is considered as the\nrepresentative damage of the variant. (2) Solid experimental evidence on\nmis-splicing or coding impact of a variant, if available, can override\ncomputational predictions. For a schematic illustration of the taxonomy, see\nFig. 2 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig2].\n\nDAMAGE TO CANONICAL SPLICING\n\n(1) Severe: (i) SpliceAI donor/acceptor loss score at a canonical splice\nsite ≥ 0.1, (ii) MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the ALT allele at the site\n< MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the REF allele at the site, AND (iii)\n[MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the ALT allele at the site < 2] OR\n[MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the ALT allele at the site < 0.3 ×\nMaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the REF allele at the site].\n\n(2) Moderate: (i) NOT severe (as defined above), (ii) SpliceAI donor/acceptor\nloss score at a canonical splice site ≥ 0.1, AND (iii) [MaxEntScan\ndonor/acceptor score with the ALT allele at the site < MaxEntScan donor/acceptor\nscore with the REF allele at the site, MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the\nALT allele at the site ≥ 2, AND MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the ALT\nallele at the site ≥ 0.3 × MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the REF allele\nat the site] OR [The variant is ≤3 nt away from the LaBranchoR-predicted\nbranchpoint OR the distance between the LaBranchoR-predicted branchpoint and the\nsite is changed by >3 nt by the variant].\n\n(3) No to little: NEITHER severe NOR moderate (as defined above).\n\nDAMAGE TO PROTEIN-CODING FUNCTION\n\n(1) Severe: (i) frameshift, stop-gain, or start-loss variant OR (ii) missense\nvariant predicted as pathogenic by REVEL (score > 0.5).\n\n(2) No to little: (i) NOT severe AND (ii) synonymous variant or missense variant\npredicted as benign by REVEL (score ≤ 0.5).\n\nMIS-SPLICING TYPE\n\n(1) Gain of mis-splicing (gain): (i) SpliceAI donor/acceptor gain score at a\nnon-canonical site ≥ 0.1 AND (ii) MaxEntScan donor/acceptor score with the ALT\nallele at the site ≥ 2.\n\n(2) Exon skipping or intron retention (skipping or retention): SpliceAI\ndonor/acceptor loss score at any canonical site ≥ 0.1 without an accompanying\ngain of mis-splicing by SpliceAI (donor/acceptor gain score < 0.1 at any\nnon-canonical splice site).\n\n(3) Neither: NEITHER gain, skipping, NOR retention.\n\n\nMINIGENE ASSAY\n\nPLASMID CONSTRUCTION\n\nTo generate a minigene, we used the pSpliceExpress plasmid, which was a gift\nfrom S. Stamm (Addgene plasmid 32485; http://n2t.net/addgene:32485\n[http://n2t.net/addgene:32485]; RRID: Addgene_32485; ref. 61\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR61]). The genomic\nfragment with a variant of interest was cloned into the pSpliceExpress donor\nvector using the BP recombination reaction. The inserted fragments for reference\nand alternative alleles were generated by a two-step PCR procedure. In the first\nround of PCR, the genomic region of interest was amplified from patient gDNA\nwith attB tagged primers, which added 12 nucleotides of the attB1 and attB2\nsites to the ends of amplicons. The second PCR reaction used the first PCR\nproducts as templates and extended them to contain complete attB sequences using\nuniversal adapter primer pairs. All PCR reactions were performed with Phusion\nHot Start II DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or PrimeSTAR GXL DNA\npolymerase (Takara Bio). Primer sequences used for minigene constructions were\nlisted in Supplementary Table 10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]. Full attB PCR\nproducts were purified using the PureLink PCR Purification Kit or PureLink Quick\nGel Extraction Kit (Invitrogen). Gateway BP Clonase II Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen)\nwas used to recombine attB PCR products into pSpliceExpress. In brief,\napproximately 25 fmol (1 kb PCR product is 0.65 ng fmol−1) of purified attB PCR\nproduct was added to 75 ng of donor vector, TE buffer and 1 µl of BP Clonase\nEnzyme Mix to a final reaction volume of 5 µl. The reaction was incubated at\nroom temperature for 1 h, after which 0.5 µl Proteinase K was added to stop the\nreaction. One microlitre of each BP Clonase reaction product was transformed\ninto 25 µl OneShot TOP10 Chemically Competent Escherichia coli (Thermo Fisher\nScientific). Transformed E. coli was spread on LB agar plates with ampicillin\n(1× LB agar with 50 µg ml−1 ampicillin) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. To\nscreen for positive colonies containing the desired plasmids, a dozen colonies\nfor each variant were picked up and diluted in 50 µl sterile water.\nSubsequently, colony PCRs were performed using Phusion Hot Start II DNA\npolymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed with 2% agarose gel inspection.\nThe cycling programme was: bacteria were lysed and DNA was denatured at 98 °C\nfor 10 min, followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, optimal annealing\ntemperature for 20 s and 72 °C for 30 s, and final extension for 5 min at 72 °C.\nPrimer sequences used for colony PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]. Positive colonies\nwere inoculated in liquid LB with ampicillin (1× LB and 50 µg ml−1 ampicillin)\nand were cultured in a shaking incubator at 275 rpm at 37 °C for 12–18 h.\nPlasmid DNA was extracted from overnight cultures using PureLink Quick Plasmid\nMiniprep Kit (Invitrogen) or ZR plasmid Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research). The\ngenotypes and the sequences of plasmid inserts were confirmed by Sanger\nsequencing (Supplementary Table 11\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). At least one\nwild-type and one mutant plasmid were identified for each variant.\n\nIn some variants, full attB PCR products could not be amplified directly from\npatient gDNA owing to low quality or unavailability of the patient gDNA. In\nthese cases, a wild-type fragment was amplified from human male gDNA (Promega)\nand used to construct reference plasmids as described above. The Q5\nsite-directed mutagenesis kit was used to introduce the variants into the\nreference plasmids (New England Biolabs). Twenty-five-microlitre PCR reactions\nwere set up with mutagenic primers (Supplementary Table 10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]) and Q5 Hot Start\nHigh Fidelity 2X Master Mix to introduce the variant into the reference plasmids\nand amplify the mutant plasmids. The samples were denatured at 98 °C for 30 s\nand subjected to 25 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 50–72 °C (various annealing\ntemperatures were tested) for 10 to 30 s, 72 °C for 20–30 s per kb, followed by\na final extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The linear PCR products were ligated into\nthe plasmid through DpnI restriction digestion and ligation. The mutant plasmids\nwere transformed into competent E. coli. Single colonies were screened and\ninoculated in liquid LB and ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was collected from overnight\ncultures.\n\nSPLICING ASSAY\n\nAround 1 × 105 HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates. When the cells\nreached about 90% confluency, they were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each transfection, 4 µl of plasmid was added to\neach well along with 1.5 µl Lipofectamine, 2 µl P3000 and 50 µl Opti-MEM (Thermo\nFisher Scientific). For some transfections, ASOs were also added at a final\nconcentration of 200 µM. Twenty-four hours after transfection, total RNA was\nextracted using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen). RNA was then\nreverse-transcribed into cDNA in a 4-μl total reaction consisting of 3 µl RNA\nand 1 µl of SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The\nreverse transcription reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, 50 °C for\n10 min and 85 °C for 5 min. To detect transcripts transcribed from the\ntransfected plasmids, 1 µl cDNA was amplified using Phusion Hot Start II DNA\npolymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2× KAPA SYBR Fast qPCR Master Mix (Kapa\nBiosystems) or 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems). For primers, we\nused rat insulin primers that bind to the minigene exons flanking the inserted\nATM gene region (Supplementary Table 10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]). The final PCR\nproducts were run and visualized on 2% agarose gel. Mis-splicing bands were\nextracted using the PureLink Quick Gel Extraction (Invitrogen) and confirmed by\nSanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 12\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]).\n\nQUALITY CONTROL\n\nIf the amount of the canonical splicing isoform represented less than 50% of the\ntotal amount of all ATM isoforms, we disqualified and excluded the minigene\nassay plasmids for further analysis. We found that some of the plasmids bearing\nthe ATM gene region did not express the normally spliced isoform even without\nany variant, which makes them unsuitable to assess the mis-splicing effects of\nvariants. Therefore, we excluded them from the analysis. The minigene assay\nplasmids carrying the ATM gene contexts of two variants (c.3489C>T [in\nDDP_ATCP_138] and c.4801A>G [in DDP_ATCP_302]) did not pass this criterion as\nthey showed predominant skipping of the exon of interest even in the absence of\nthe variant of interest in the ATM gene region of the plasmids.\n\n\nASO DEVELOPMENT\n\nASOS\n\nFor c.7865C>T, a total of 32 ASOs were designed (12 for the initial screening\nand 20 for the fine-tuning screening). The ASOs were designed to be\ncomplementary to either the region encompassing the novel splice donor site in\nexon 53 created by c.7865C>T or predicted splice silencers surrounding the exon\n53 canonical splice donor site. These silencers were predicted on the basis of a\npreviously published hexamer-based model62\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR62]. For\nc.5763-1050A>G, a total of 27 ASOs were designed (12 for the initial screening\nand 15 for the fine-tuning screening) to be complementary to the regions\nencompassing the novel splice donor site in intron 38 created by c.5763-1050A>G,\nthe cryptic acceptor site of the pseudoexon in intron 38 or predicted splice\nsilencers within the pseudoexon (also predicted on the basis of the hexamer\nmodel). For minigene-based validation of ASO amenability, a total of 24 ASOs\nwere designed for 4 ASO-amenable variants (c.2839-579_2839-576del,\nc.2839-581G>A, c.6348-986G>T and c.3994-159A>G). The ASOs were designed to block\neither the splice donor/acceptor site or predicted exonic splicing silencers\nwithin a pseudoexon of interest. NT-20 and NT-22 (non-targeting oligonucleotides\nwith the same chemistry) were used as negative controls1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR1]. For in vitro\ntoxicity testing, ASO-tox, a gapmer with known toxicity, was used. All ASO\nsequences and detailed chemical modifications of ASOs are provided in\nSupplementary Table 13\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]. All ASOs were\nmanufactured by Microsynth. The ASO drug substance used in the atipeksen N-of-1\nclinical trial was manufactured by ChemGenes in accordance with GMP guidelines.\n\nASO SCREENING\n\nFibroblasts were transfected with 200 nM ASOs using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo\nFisher Scientific). Twenty-four hours after transfection, total RNA was isolated\nusing PureLink RNA Mini (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis using oligo-dT and random\nhexamers was performed using the Superscript VILO reverse transcriptase kit\n(Invitrogen). For allele-specific PCR, primers were designed to specifically\nexclude the non-target allele in each patient (Extended Data Figs. 6d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig11] and 9c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig14] and Supplementary\nTable 14 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]). For\nc.5763-1050A>G, the distance between the two ATM variants was too far (around\n2 kb) to distinguish the two bands representing normally and abnormally spliced\nproducts (which differ by 137 bp) on a agarose gel; therefore, a nested PCR was\nperformed. PCR was performed using 1 µl of cDNA and a standard condition (35\ncycles; 98 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 45 s). Relative quantities of\nthe normally and abnormally spliced transcripts were measured by 1.5% agarose\ngel electrophoresis and densitometry analysis using ImageJ.\n\n\nASO VALIDATION\n\nIMMUNOBLOTTING\n\nFibroblasts were transfected with 400 nM ASO as described above. Forty-eight\nhours after transfection, cells were irradiated with 10 Gy using a caesium-137\nsource, and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were then collected\nusing RIPA buffer (Boston Bioproducts) supplemented with Roche PhosSTOP\n(Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were incubated with 4× Laemmli buffer (BioRad) and\nloaded onto 4–15% precast gradient protein gels (BioRad) and separated by\nelectrophoresis. Protein samples were then transferred to PVDF membranes, which\nwere subsequently incubated overnight with primary antibodies for phospho-P53\n(Cell Signaling Tech, diluted 1:500) and phospho-KAP1 (Bethyl Lab, diluted\n1:1,000). GAPDH was used as a loading control and primary antibody for GAPDH\n(Proteintech) was diluted to 1:250. Following incubation with secondary\nantibodies that were diluted to 1:5,000 for phospho-P53, phospho-KAP1 and GAPDH\n(Li-Cor), targets were visualized with the Li-Cor Odyssey system and quantified\nwith densitometry analysis (ImageJ).\n\nIMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY\n\nFibroblasts were transfected with 200 nM of ASOs as described above. Forty-eight\nhours after transfection, cells were irradiated with 1.5 Gy using a caesium-137\nsource, and then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed in PBS, fixed\nin 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in\nPBS at room temperature. Cells were then incubated overnight in PBS with 3% BSA\nand antibodies to phospho-P53 (Cell Signaling Tech) and phospho-KAP1 (Bethyl\nLab) and were visualized with immunoglobulin G Alexa Fluor conjugates (Life\nTechnologies). DNA was counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Images were collected\nwith the ImageXpress Micro microscope (Molecular Devices) and processed with\nMetaXpress (Molecular Devices). The abundance of targets expressed in nuclei was\nquantified.\n\nDOSE–RESPONSE\n\nFibroblasts were electroporated using the Neon Transfection System (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) with varying amounts of ASOs: 0–1,000 nM (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20,\n50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000 nM; final concentrations). Twenty-four hours after\nelectroporation, total RNA was isolated as described above. cDNA synthesis,\nRT–PCR, gel electrophoresis and densitometry were performed as described above.\n\nRNA-SEQ\n\nFibroblasts were transfected with 200 nM of ASOs as described above. Forty-eight\nhours after transfection, total RNA was isolated as described above. RNA-seq\nlibraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep kit (KAPA Biosystems).\nSequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (for sequencing; 2 × 100 bp).\nFor alignment, STAR (v.2.7.5c) (ref. 63\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR63]) was used to map\nreads on GRCh38/hg38 in the paired-end, two-pass mode to yield BAM files that\nwere sorted by chromosomal coordinates. Gene annotation was not provided to the\nalignment program to avoid any biased alignment favouring annotated splice\njunctions. The sorted BAM files were indexed using SAMtools (v.1.10) (ref. 64\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR64]). IGV was used to\ndraw sashimi plots, which showed the number of reads supporting splice\njunctions.\n\nOFF-TARGET ANALYSIS\n\nThe following derivative sequences were computationally generated from the\nsequences of AT008 (atipeksen), AT026, AT056, nusinersen and milasen: (1)\nsequences with progressively trimmed ends, starting from the full-length ASO\nsequences down to 16 nt in length; (2) sequences with up to 2 nt mismatches; and\n(3) sequences with a 1-nt internal insertion or deletion (Supplementary Figs. 5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]–8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3] and 11\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3]). BWA (v.0.7.17)\n(ref. 46 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#ref-CR46]) was used\nto align the generated sequences on GRCh38/hg38 and the RefSeq transcriptome\nsequences, downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser.\n\nIN VITRO ASO TOXICITY ASSAY\n\nAn FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD 556547, BD Biosciences) was used\nto quantitatively measure the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis after\ntransfection with ASOs at different concentrations as described above. Cells\nwere collected, washed with PBS and resuspended in 1× binding buffer four days\nafter transfection. Five hundred microlitres of the resuspended cells was\nstained with 5 µl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 µl propidium iodide (PI) in the dark\nat room temperature for 15 min. The cells were analysed using a flow cytometer\n(BD FACSAria III system) and were quantified by FlowJo software. The\nAnnexin-V-positive and PI-negative fraction was ‘early apoptotic’, and the\nAnnexin-V-positive and PI-positive fraction was ‘late apoptotic or necrotic’.\n\n\nREPORTING SUMMARY\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM2]\nlinked to this article.\n\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY\n\nRaw WGS data for the ATCP cohort are available from the Global A-T Family Data\nPlatform (https://atfamilies.org [https://atfamilies.org/]) through the Terra\ncloud server after obtaining approval from ATCP.

The absence of this variant in both gnomAD v3.1 and TOPMed freeze 8,\nwith an allele frequency of 0.0, is consistent with a potential pathogenic role.\nDeclaring this variant as disease-causing could complete the genetic diagnosis\nfor DDP_ATCP_368. However, owing to a lack of substantial evidence confirming\nthat the enhancer-like element is functional, and that the variant disrupts its\nfunction, we have refrained from declaring this variant as a disease candidate.\nFor more details, see Supplementary Note 2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM3].\n\n\nEXTENDED DATA FIG. 2 DISEASE CANDIDATE CNVS.\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/7]\n\na, All disease candidate CNVs (26 mutational events, 25 patients including one\nhomozygote, 10 unique variants; Supplementary Table 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]). b, A recurrent (16\nmutational events, 15 patients including one homozygote) CNV event, which\ndeletes the last two ATM exons (exon 62 and 63). The deletion is found in 15\npatients (DDP_ATCP_50 is homozygous). c, A recurrent (2 mutational events, 2\npatients) CNV event, which deletes exon 17 through 63. Precise breakpoints of\nthese two deletions are yet to be pinpointed. d, Two CNV events that duplicate a\nportion of the ATM gene, exon 17–61 and exon 53–61.\n\n\nEXTENDED DATA FIG. 3 DISEASE CANDIDATE VARIANT CHARACTERISTICS.\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/8]\n\na, Representation of disease candidate variants in ClinVar. Total disease\ncandidate variants (n = 469) by ClinVar interpretation category and comparison\nof the composition of ClinVar interpretation categories of probably/possibly\nASO-amenable variants versus unlikely ASO-amenable variants are shown. 73%\n(343/469) of all the disease candidate mutational events had been classified in\nClinVar as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, 8.7% (41/469) as conflicting\ninterpretations of pathogenicity or uncertain significance, 0.6% (3/469) as\nlikely benign, and 17% (82/469) had not been reported in ClinVar. We note in\nparticular that the three likely benign mutational events (c.3489C>T, n = 1;\nc.2639-22_2639-20del, n = 2) have strongly predicted mis-splicing potential and\nhave not been found in gnomAD v3.1 and TOPMed freeze 8 (Supplementary Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#MOESM4]); because no other\nvariants can explain the clinical diagnosis in the respective patients, we\nconsidered them as disease candidate variants. b, Recurrence of disease\ncandidate variants. The recurrence distribution of disease candidate variants in\n235 patients in the ATCP cohort is depicted. Homozygous variants are\ndouble-counted. The inset shows a magnified view of the dotted box region in the\nmain graph.\n\n\nEXTENDED DATA FIG. 4 POSSIBLY ASO-AMENABLE VARIANTS AND ASO TREATMENT GROUPS.\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0/figures/9]\n\na, Cases indicate the number of patients having the variant in the ATCP cohort\nof 235 patients.

Note: this case is not in the ATCP cohort and is not the same case as\nDDP_ATCP_520, who is a currently 20-year-old patient with c.7865C>T. The\npaternally inherited c.8585-13_8598del variant disrupts the canonical splice\nacceptor site of exon 59, leading to the skipping of exon 59 (87 nucleotides),\nand removes critical residues from the highly conserved PI3K/PI4K kinase domain\nof the ATM protein. Although it is in-frame, because the skipped region contains\na critical kinase domain, it results in complete loss of function. The\nmaternally inherited c.7865C>T variant creates a novel splice site in exon 54,\nleading to mis-splicing that results in an out-of-frame truncation of 64\nnucleotides from the 3′ end of exon 53. b, RNA-seq analysis of the trio’s\nfibroblast cell lines shows the gain-of-splicing effect in exon 53 by c.7865C>T\nin the patient and the mother. c, RNA-seq analysis of the trio’s fibroblast cell\nlines shows the gain-of-splicing effect in exon 59 by c.8585-13_8598del in the\npatient and the father. d, Determination of the gain-of-splicing effect of\nc.7865C>T in the trio’s fibroblast cell lines by allele-specific PCR that is\nspecifically designed to exclude the non-target (parental) allele. This result\nof the allele-specific PCR on the naive patient fibroblasts was replicated in 11\nadditional biologically independent experiments (n = 3, initial; n = 2,\nfine-tuning; n = 3, AT008 dose–response; n = 3, AT026 dose–response; Fig. 5a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig5] and Extended Data Fig.\n8c [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06277-0#Fig13]).

The resulting mis-splicing truncates 120 nt from the 3’ end of\nexon 26. b, RNA-seq analysis of whole-blood samples from the patient and three\nother patients without c.5763-1050A>G shows the pseudoexon inclusion effect\nbetween exon 38 and exon 39 by c.5763-1050A>G. c, Determination of the\npseudoexon inclusion effect of c.5763-1050A>G in the patient’s fibroblast cell\nline by allele-specific RT–PCR that is specifically designed to exclude the\nnon-target allele (c.3993+1G>A). Because the distance between the two ATM\nvariants were too far (~2 kb) to distinguish the two bands representing normally\nand abnormally spliced products (which differ by 137 bp) on an agarose gel, a\nnested PCR was performed.

The scope and mechanisms of behavioural\nmodifications by the immune system is not yet well understood. Here, using mouse\nmodels of food allergy, we show that allergic sensitization drives\nantigen-specific avoidance behaviour. Allergen ingestion activates brain areas\ninvolved in the response to aversive stimuli, including the nucleus of tractus\nsolitarius, parabrachial nucleus, and central amygdala. Allergen avoidance\nrequires IgE antibodies and mast cells but precedes the development of gut\nallergic inflammation. The ability of allergen-specific IgE and mast cells to\npromote avoidance requires cysteinyl leukotrienes and growth and differentiation\nfactor 15 (GDF15). Finally, a comparison of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse strains\nrevealed a strong effect of the genetic background on the avoidance behaviour.\nThese findings thus point to antigen-specific behavioural modifications that\nlikely evolved to promote niche selection to avoid unfavourable environments.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\n[https://wayf.springernature.com/?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06362-4]\n\n\nACCESS OPTIONS\n\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n\n$29.99 / 30 days\n\ncancel any time\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\nReceive 51 print issues and online access\n\n$199.00 per year\n\nonly $3.90 per issue\n\nRent or buy this article\n\nPrices vary by article type\n\nfrom$1.95\n\nto$39.95\n\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\n\n\nADDITIONAL ACCESS OPTIONS:\n\n * Log in\n   [https://idp.nature.com/authorize/natureuser?client_id=grover&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06362-4]\n * Learn about institutional subscriptions\n   [https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/license-options]\n * Read our FAQs [https://support.nature.com/en/support/home]\n * Contact customer support [https://www.springernature.com/gp/contact]\n\n\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\n\nAuthor notes\n\n 1.

        "content": "Everyone poops [https://www.chroniclebooks.com/products/everyone-poops-hc], but\nit turns out we don’t all need to poop every day.\n\nThat’s a misconception, said gastroenterologist Dr. Folasade May, an associate\nprofessor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles.\n\n“I even have people who try and make appointments, because they say, ‘Oh, I\nstopped having a bowel movement every single day a few years ago,’” May said.\n“And I have to remind people that there’s really not a fixed or normal number of\nbowel movements.”\n\nThat notion probably stems from a Victorian-era belief that having a bowel\nmovement daily makes you healthier, said Dr. Michael Camilleri, a consultant and\nprofessor in the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at the Mayo Clinic\nin Minnesota.\n\nNot necessarily. “Most people will have anywhere between a bowel movement up to\nthree times a day to three times per week,” May added. “Anywhere in that range,\nwe consider normal.”\n\nWhen it comes to bowel movements as a measure of health, frequency isn’t the\nonly important factor. And several factors can influence how often we poop,\nincluding diet, hydration, stress, age, medication use and social circumstances,\nsaid Dr. Trisha Pasricha, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital\nand instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\nARE YOUR POOP PATTERNS RIGHT FOR YOU?\n\nIt’s helpful to know what your poop looks like in addition to just how often you\npoop.\n\n“The stool form, appearance or consistency of the bowel movement is actually a\nmuch better criterion than the simple numbers to frequency,” Camilleri said.\n\nMedical professionals assess stool quality using the Bristol Stool Chart\n[https://www.continence.org.au/bristol-stool-chart], which classifies stools\ninto seven groups. The healthiest kinds of poop are types three and four — stool\nthat’s shaped like a sausage with cracks on the surface or snakelike and smooth.\n\nIf you’re pooping three times per week and the consistency is hard or\npebble-like, that could be fine if you haven’t experienced any change in your\nquality of life, Pasricha said.\n\nBut if you’re excessively straining when trying to poop or feeling like you\nhaven’t totally emptied your bowel, you may need to make changes to either poop\nmore often or have healthier stool quality, experts said.\n\nPutting your feet on a toilet stool — or even a stack of books — could help.\nDoing so raises your knees above your hips, relaxing the pelvic floor muscles\nthat support your bowel and allowing poop to pass through more easily, Pasricha\nsaid.\n\n“We did not evolve to have our bowel movements sitting with our hips at 90\ndegrees on a chair, which is what we do now. We used to all have bowel movements\nsquatting,” she said. “Sitting at that sort of upright, 90-degree angle actually\ncloses off the passageway.”\n\n\nHOW TO HAVE HEALTHY POOP\n\nJust like we need to make good choices to get restful sleep, we need to make\nwise food and drink choices to keep our bowels healthy.\n\nEating enough fiber from vegetables, fruits, whole grains and nuts can help\nprevent constipation, experts said. Total fiber intake should be at least 25\ngrams daily, according to the US Food and Drug Administration\n[https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=101.77#:~:text=Recommended%20total%20dietary%20fiber%20intakes,g)%20should%20be%20soluble%20fiber.].\n\nSome studies have found kiwis and prunes can be especially helpful for relieving\nconstipation, experts said. But don’t eat too much fiber, as that has been\nlinked with abdominal bloating or loose stools, experts said.\n\nBeing sufficiently hydrated softens the stool so you can pass it without\nstraining, May said.\n\n“Coffee, or caffeinated beverages, have also been shown to stimulate the\ncontractions of the colon,” Camilleri said, noting they can induce bowel\nmovements.\n\nA high-fat diet, on the other hand, can slow your digestive system down, May\nadded.\n\n\nWHAT ELSE AFFECTS OUR BOWEL MOVEMENTS?\n\nMovement also matters. Many people in the US live sedentary lifestyles, May\nsaid, but exercising helps\n[https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/fitness-life-but-better] your digestive tract\nmassage and move food, promoting the passage of stool.\n\nHow fast or slow food moves through the digestive tract can also depend on\ngenetics, May said, and our digestive systems tend to slow down as we age.\n\nMedical conditions such as hypothyroidism, irritable bowel syndrome, irritable\nbowel disease or ulcerative colitis can affect regularity, as well as some\nmedications, such as opioids and antidepressants. Having a baby or gaining and\nlosing a lot of weight can also cause pelvic floor dysfunction, making poop\ndifficult to expel, May said.\n\nStress can also affect our bowel movements. When we eat our stomachs stretch,\nsending a message from there to the brain then down the spinal cord, the nerves\nof which induce colon contractions, Camilleri said — resulting in a bowel\nmovement. But if we’re stressed, hormones and nervous system changes can prevent\npoop from moving toward the rectum, resulting in constipation. Some people\nexperience the other extreme — diarrhea — when stressed.\n\nBowel regularity can also be influenced by not responding to urges to poop due\nto not having easy or private access to bathrooms, experts said. Some people\nmight feel embarrassed to poop around others at work or school.\n\nBut don’t delay — the right time to poop is when you’re feeling the urge to do\nso, experts said.\n\nIf you have to sit on the toilet for more than five to 10 minutes, you should\ndiscuss the issue with your doctor, Camilleri said. Bloating or abdominal\ndistension or pain are other signs that your bowel movement frequency is\nnegatively affecting your health.\n\nBut if you’re taking too long on the toilet because you’re using your phone,\nstop letting that distract you, Camilleri said.\n\nIf lifestyle changes don’t work, a doctor would be able to prescribe\nmedications, supplements or laxatives that can aid in regularity.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

At 290 pounds, he realized everything he'd tried\npreviously hadn't worked. So he decided to do the opposite.\n\nInstead of trying to lose weight as fast as possible, he decided to go slowly\n[https://www.insider.com/is-it-better-to-lose-weight-fast-or-slowly-2020-12].\nInstead of cutting out carbs, demonizing certain foods, or living off\nmeal-replacement shakes, he aimed to keep eating everything. \"I'm not going to\nask myself to give up ice cream for 10 years, that's dumb,\" Terrell told\nInsider.\n\nInstead of setting complicated diet rules, he decided to eat only when hungry.\nInstead of weighing himself regularly and obsessing over the number, he stepped\non the scale once a month.\n\nHe started swimming for short periods and felt like he was \"dying\" until he\ngradually built up his fitness and began lifting weights, doing calisthenics,\nand running.\n\nTerrell lost 125 pounds 2 ½ years later, and he's kept the weight off for 1 ½\nyears so far.\n\nTerrell lost weight slowly and has kept it off. Chris Terrell\n\nResearch suggests that slow weight loss is more sustainable\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-lose-weight-2018-3?r=US&IR=T] than fast,\nand nutrition experts generally don't recommend overly restrictive diets because\nthey are hard to stick to and can lead to a \"binge-restrict\" cycle\n[https://www.insider.com/what-nutritionists-would-order-taco-bell-high-protein-meal-2022-9].\n\n\nTHE DEATH OF HIS FATHER CHANGED TERRELL'S OUTLOOK\n\nTerrell changed his outlook in many ways after his father died in the spring of\n2019 — but one of the big ones was how he viewed time.\n\nHe realized that always waiting for motivation to strike\n[https://www.insider.com/exercise-gym-motivation-how-to-find-secret-tips-fitness-2019-7]\nwasn't working. So when Terrell's brother-in-law challenged him to move for 20\nminutes three times a week, he agreed. He swam three times a week, and he took a\nlong, hard look at his diet and eating habits.\n\nTerrell didn't want to fail again, so he decided to start small — he didn't\ncount calories, but he tried to only eat when hungry.\n\n\"I thought, if I had just started 10 years ago, I'd be done by now, even if I\nonly lost a pound a month.\" he said. \"The last thing I want to do is sit there\non my deathbed thinking, oh, if only I had just started,\" he said.\n\nTerrell didn't think about losing 100 pounds. He thought about losing just one\npound and doing that again and again. He ended up losing 30 pounds in the first\nsix months.\n\n\nTERRELL APPROACHED HIS HEALTH LIKE BUSINESS\n\nTerrell lost 125 pounds by making small changes. Chris Terrell\n\nTerrell said he had always enjoyed problem-solving, working on multiyear\nprojects, and making organizational change happen\n[https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/change-management-process#:~:text=Change%20management%20is%20the%20process,any%20changes%20that%20may%20occur.]\nbecause he worked for the chief operating officer of a commercial cleaning\ncompany.\n\n\"I thought, why am I not approaching my life the same way?\" Terrell said.\n\nHe turned his focus inward and approached his weight loss like a business\nchallenge.\n\nTerrell conducted a root-cause analysis to find the underlying cause of why his\nprevious weight-loss attempts\n[https://www.insider.com/bryan-okeeffe-weight-loss-program-pounds-spain-viral-tiktok-2023-2]\nhad failed.\n\n\"Every single time I lost weight\n[https://www.insider.com/body-recomposition-how-to-lose-fat-build-muscle-2023-6],\nI would always gain it back plus more because I never addressed the real\nproblem. I always put the weight back on because I was the same person as when I\nstarted,\" Terrell said.\n\nHe compared it to shoveling water from a sinking boat instead of plugging the\nleak.\n\nThis time, Terrell thought about weight-loss maintenance before he even started\nlosing weight to make sure he was starting lifestyle changes that he was willing\nto continue for at least 10 years.\n\nHe addressed his thoughts as much as his actions and worked on his \"terrible\"\nrelationship with food.\n\nTerrell was used to gaining weight and crash dieting, so he aimed simply not to\ngain more weight or to lose it slowly — less than 2 lbs a week on average.\n\n\"As long as the scale wasn't going up, I was moving in the right direction,\"\nTerrell said.\n\n\nTERRELL REDUCED THE STRESSORS IN HIS LIFE\n\nTerrell realized his lifestyle made it extremely easy to gain weight. He moved\nas little as possible, stayed up till 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. every night playing video\ngames or watching TV, and ate lots of junk food out of habit. As a\nself-proclaimed \"workaholic,\" his meetings focused on food, too.\n\nTerrell realized this was his \"obesity model\"— in other words, the very\neffective recipe for his weight gain — which then helped him work out what was\nholding him back. He identified the stressors in his life, including an unhappy\nrelationship and a job at a company that didn't value him, and removed them.\n\nTaking action to make himself happy and reduce negative stressors helped Terrell\ndevelop a healthier lifestyle.\n\nHe began video journaling to document his journey and put note cards around his\nhouse to help him stay on track.\n\nTerrell now shares his journey and advice for others as a weight loss coach\n[https://www.christerrellcoaching.com/] and on social media, including TikTok\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@og_chris_terrell/], where he has over 280,000\nfollowers."

New evidence suggests that one particular\ncompound derived from breast milk, the sugar myo-inositol, might play an\nimportant role in the maturation of the newborn brain.\n\nThe research [https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2221413120] was\npublished in PNAS.\n\n\nA VITAL PERIOD FOR THE DEVELOPING BRAIN\n\nHuman milk helps the human body develop through a period of unrivalled change.\nOver the first year of life, babies usually triple\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/infant-growth/faq-20058037#:~:text=Healthy%20infants%20come%20in%20a,weights%20by%20the%20first%20birthday.]\ntheir body weight. To encourage this growth, milk contains proteins and\nimportant fats and carbohydrates, alongside a rich cocktail of immune-boosting\nmolecules like cytokines and antibodies\n[https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/infographics/introducing-the-antibody-342975].\n\nThe first 12 months of an infant’s life is also a transformative period for the\nbrain. Researchers have noted that in this early stage of life, the barriers\nbetween the gut, bloodstream and brain are unusually fragile, suggesting that\nwhat babies consume is likely [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12955493/] to\nhave an outsize impact on how their brains develop.\n\nIn a new study, a multi-institution team analyzed the rich milieu of breast milk\nstored during the Global Exploration of Human Milk study. Using samples from\nMexico City, Shanghai and Cincinnati, the team looked at how molecular\ncontributions to breast milk changed over the first year of life, with the aim\nof analyzing the ingredients that might be most prominent during important\nperiods of infant brain growth. During the first few weeks after birth, the\nhuman brain starts rapidly forming neuronal connections, imprinting circuits\nthat will serve the brain throughout life.\n\nIn breast milk sampled from mothers while their infants were in this early stage\nof life, the team noted that levels of the sugar myo-inositol were consistently\nhigh, before dropping off towards the end of the first year, a change which\nmimics the density of synaptic connections in the growing brain. Similar levels\nof the sugar were seen across all three sample sites.\n\n\nMILK FOR MICE\n\nThe team decided to assess myo-inositol’s effect on the brain using a handful of\ndifferent lab techniques. First, they showed that human neurons exposed to\nmyo-inositol exhibited higher levels of a marker called Homer, which is linked\nto the development of post-synaptic connections. No such effect was seen for an\nequivalent pre-synaptic marker called Bassoon.\n\nThe effects appeared to be stronger in mouse neurons exposed to myo-inositol –\nthese cells showed increases of roughly 40% in levels of both Homer and Bassoon.\n\nThe researchers then took their work a step further, by feeding newborn mouse\npups a myo-inositol supplement everyday from birth to postnatal day 35. At this\npoint, their visual cortexes, a region of the brain that rapidly develops after\nbirth, were examined for markers of synaptic growth. While the density of these\nmarkers did not change in myo-inositol-fed pups, the size of each marker seen\nincreased. This, say the authors, further supports the theory that myo-inositol\ncan increase branching in the developing brain.\n\nExcitingly, a final experiment showed that myo-inositol is also able to exert\nits effects on mature brain tissue samples.

While lounging\ncan certainly be a good time every once in a while, researchers from the\nUniversity of Limerick have uncovered yet another reason for everyone to\nprioritize a little bit of movement — especially older individuals. Their study\nfinds modest amounts of physical activity each day can reduce the risk of\ndepression.\n\nThis research, conducted in collaboration with Trinity College Dublin, reports\nthat a “dose” equal to just 20 minutes per day (for five days a week) of\nmoderate-intensity physical activity (brisk walking\n[https://studyfinds.org/nine-minutes-brisk-walking-every-day-keeps-disabilities-away-older-adults/],\nfor example) displayed an association to less risk of depressive symptoms and\nchances of major depression.\n\nDepression, of course, is an increasingly common condition among older adults.\nMeanwhile, depression is also linked to a host of significant risk factors for\nmajor chronic conditions like cognitive decline, cardiovascular disease, chronic\npain, and even an increased risk of death and suicide.\n\nAll in all, estimates show that depression causes around five to 10 percent of\nthe burden of all diseases in Europe.

Physical activity at lower doses than World Health\nOrganization recommendations for overall health may offer protection against\ndepressive symptoms and Major Depression – at minimum, try to engage in 20\nminutes a day of moderate-intensity activity at least five days per week, with\nmore benefits seen at higher doses,” Dr. Laird reports.\n\n“Try and build it into a routine with hobbies or activities you enjoy and trying\nto do it with others as social interactions particularly with activity can also\nhave mental health benefits [https://studyfinds.org/benefits-of-gardening/].\nRemember that it is one component, and that nutrition and healthy lifestyle will\nalso give additive benefits in addition to the physical activity.”\n\n“The current findings have significant implications in highlighting that\nsignificant antidepressant benefits\n[https://studyfinds.org/magic-mushroom-drug-depression/] appear to be associated\nwith doses of physical activity that are lower than current World Health\nOrganization recommendations for overall health, though greater doses were\nassociated with stronger protection,” concludes Dr. Matthew Herring, a Senior\nLecturer and Investigator in the Physical Activity for Health Research Centre at\nUL and Principal Investigator of this HRB-funded research.\n\n“We are clearly not advocating for lower physical activity among the older adult\npopulation, but findings suggest that the largest improvements in protection\nagainst depression among older adults may be made by engaging inactive older\nadults in physical activity even at doses below those recommended for overall\nhealth.”\n\nThe study [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807113]\nis published in JAMA.\n\nYouTube video [https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sLqXrcl2EBI/hqdefault.jpg]"

        "content": "The recent cases\n[https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/new_info/2023/malaria_florida.html] of malaria\nidentified in Florida and Texas may have you wondering if the U.S. is turning\ninto a paradise for tropical diseases typically associated with foreign travel.\nThese cases—four in Sarasota County, Florida, and one in Cameron County,\nTexas—were in people who had not recently traveled outside the U.S. These are\nthe first locally acquired ones since eight cases occurred in Palm Beach County,\nFlorida, in 2003.\n\nThe truth is that the potential for malaria in the U.S. has never gone away,\nexperts say. These cases are the latest reminder that vigilance and precautions\nare necessary to ensure that mosquito-borne diseases eliminated from the U.S.\ndon’t return and illnesses from the ones already here don’t grow worse.\n\nThough an estimated 2,000 cases of malaria occur in the U.S. each year, nearly\nall of them occur in individuals who traveled from sub-Saharan Africa or South\nAsia. The Anopheles mosquitoes\n[https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/#tabs-1-5] that carry malaria are\nstill in the U.S. and just as capable of transmitting the parasite that causes\nthe disease as they were for centuries in the past, before malaria was\neliminated from the U.S.\n\n“The United States was once a place where there was a lot of malaria and\nmosquito-borne illnesses, including yellow fever,” Amesh Adalja\n[https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/amesh-adalja-md-fidsa],\nan infectious disease, pandemic, and biosecurity scientist at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, says. “There’s not some insurmountable barrier for those mosquito\ndiseases to be able to appear in the United States. What really drove back those\ndiseases was very effective vector control and making areas inhospitable for\nmosquitoes in terms of standing water.”\n\nThat’s why these new cases were not a surprise to infectious disease experts.\nPeter Hotez [https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/peter-hotez-23229], dean of the\nNational School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston,\ncalls these cases “predicted and predictable.”\n\n“The reason we’re seeing these rises in not only the Southern U.S. but other\nhotspots of the world is because of a confluence of four or five factors, which\ninclude poverty, urbanization, human migrations, and climate change,” Hotez\nsays. “Those are all converging, and because of this constellation of forces,\nwe’re seeing not only malaria but also dengue fever\n[https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areaswithrisk/in-the-us.html], Zika\n[https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html], chikungunya\n[https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/index.html], West Nile\n[https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html], Chagas disease\n[https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/index.html], typhus\n[https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/index.html], and worm infections.”\n\nIan Cheeseman [https://www.txbiomed.org/scientists/ian-cheeseman/], an\ninfectious disease researcher at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San\nAntonio, agrees, adding that the areas where these cases occurred certainly have\nthe conditions that are conducive to allowing malaria to spread.\n\n“With increased travel, the fact that we’re a much more interconnected world and\nother climate-driven features that are making transmission a little easier for\ndiseases like malaria, it’s not a massive surprise that we’re seeing a very\nsmall number of locally acquired cases.”\n\nTo help people make sense of these new cases, Adalja, Hotez, and Cheeseman spoke\nwith National Geographic about what we should know about malaria in the U.S.\n\n\nWHAT IS MALARIA AND HOW SERIOUS IS IT?\n\nMalaria is a disease caused by a parasite that’s transmitted by the\nAnopheles species of mosquito. Malaria symptoms\n[https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/faqs.html#diagnosis] include a fever and\nflu-like illness, such as shaking chills, headache, muscle aches, fatigue,\nnausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It can also cause anemia (low blood cell count)\nand jaundice, where the skin and eyes become yellow due to fewer red blood\ncells. Symptoms usually begin 7-10 days after infection but could occur as much\nas a year later.\n\nOf the five types of malaria that infect humans, the two responsible for nearly\nall of the estimated 247 million cases\n[https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria] that occurred\nglobally in 2021 are P. falciparum and P. vivax. P. falciparum is far more\ndangerous, responsible for the majority of the 619,000 global deaths from\nmalaria in 2021. Nearly all those deaths (96 percent) occurred in Africa, and\neight in ten deaths were in children under 5 years old.\n\nThe recent U.S. cases, however, were P. vivax, the malaria type found throughout\nthe world outside of Africa and a far less severe — though still serious —\nillness that is less likely to cause death. “The vivax malaria parasite tends\nonly to infect very young blood cells, and the percentage of those cells in your\nsystem usually doesn’t exceed a couple percentage points,” Hotez says. P. vivax\nis not benign, he adds, but it’s not likely to kill someone.\n\n\nHOW DID MALARIA GET TO THE U.S.? WAS IT CLIMATE CHANGE?\n\nThe environmental conditions for malaria and the mosquitoes that carry it have\nalways existed in the U.S.— but a concentrated effort to eliminate\n[https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/elimination_us.html] the disease\nsucceeded by the early 1950s.\n\n“We were able to break the chain of transmission by doing things like draining\nswamps, better housing, the advent of air conditioning and a lot of people being\ninside more and out of the way of mosquitoes during peak times [of mosquito\nactivity],” Cheeseman says.\n\nCleaning up places where mosquitoes breed played the biggest role, Adalja adds.\nFurther, most Americans have air conditioning, “especially in the areas where\nmosquitoes flourish, and mosquitoes don’t tend to like air conditioning,” he\nsays.\n\nAlthough none of the recently infected individuals had a history of travel, it\nis possible someone else in the area had come recently from a country where\nmalaria is endemic, Adalja said. The most likely scenario is that someone else\nin the county had an infection from recent travel, a local Anopheles mosquito\nbit them and contracted the parasite while feeding on their blood, and then that\nmosquito infected an individual nearby. It’s impossible to be certain that’s\nwhat occurred, but no other cases have been reported so far, suggesting there is\nnot a large population of malaria-carrying mosquitoes in those areas.\n\n\nIS THERE A VACCINE AGAINST MALARIA?\n\nYes, but it is not available in the U.S., and it does not protect against P.\nvivax malaria. The RTS,S malaria vaccine\n[https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine]\ntargets the P. falciparum parasite and reduces the risk of malaria by 50 to 75\npercent based on trials extending from 2009 through 2020. After a successful\npilot program in sub-Saharan Africa in 2019, the World Health Organization\nrecommended\n[https://www.who.int/news/item/06-10-2021-who-recommends-groundbreaking-malaria-vaccine-for-children-at-risk]\nthe vaccine in 2021 for children throughout Africa in areas with endemic P.\nfalciparum. In fact, the WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi [https://www.gavi.org/], an\ninternational vaccine nonprofit, announced\n[https://www.who.int/news/item/05-07-2023-18-million-doses-of-first-ever-malaria-vaccine-allocated-to-12-african-countries-for-2023-2025--gavi--who-and-unicef]\nJuly 5 that 12 African countries hardest hit by malaria will receive 18 million\ndoses of the vaccine over the next two years.\n\n\nSHOULD YOU WORRY ABOUT CATCHING MALARIA IN THE U.S.?\n\nThe risk of anybody catching malaria in the U.S. has not dramatically increased\nfrom a few weeks ago, even in the areas where these cases occurred, Cheeseman\nsays. The far greater risk from mosquitoes is West Nile virus\n[https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html], which arrived\n[https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007186.htm] in the U.S. in 1999 and has\nsince spread throughout the country and become the leading\n[https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsmaps/historic-data.html] cause of\nmosquito-borne disease in the continental U.S.\n\n“West Nile probably won’t get nearly as many headlines as the five malaria\ncases, but it kills more people in the U.S. every year,” Adalja said. Nearly\n3,000 people contracted West Nile virus in 2021, resulting in 227 deaths.\nMeanwhile, Hotez says, more cases of other mosquito-borne diseases will likely\ngrow over time, including dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya.\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST THESE DISEASES?\n\nFollow the same precautions you normally would to prevent mosquito bites\n[https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/mosquito-bites/prevent-mosquito-bites.html],\nstarting with using mosquito repellent when you’ll be around mosquitoes, all\nthree experts say.\n\nCheeseman also advised wearing longer clothing to cover up as much as possible,\nthough that can be difficult given the heat in areas where malaria thrives. He\nalso advises staying out of areas with mosquitoes at dusk and dawn—when\nmosquitoes are most active.\n\n“Try to keep your own property maintained as best as possible, not leaving pools\nof water or filled drains,” Cheeseman says. “Mosquitoes love to thrive in warm,\nwet places like puddles or leftover tires.”\n\n\nHOW CAN PEOPLE SLOW THE SPREAD OF THESE DISEASES, IN GENERAL?\n\nVector control is the biggest way to stop the spread of mosquito-borne\nillnesses, all three experts agreed. “One of the reasons the Gulf Coast remains\nvulnerable is because when you go into poor neighborhoods in the South, you see\nhouses without screens and dilapidated housing with a lot of drainage ditches\nfilled with water,” Hotez says. Another problem, he says, is lack of\nsurveillance for these diseases and lack of funding for public health\ndepartments to be on the lookout for these diseases and the conditions that help\nthem spread.\n\nPeople can also help by picking up trash, Adalja says. “Don’t make your yard a\nplace where mosquitoes can breed, and if you see trash in the street, pick it\nup,” he says. “All you need is a bottle cap [filled with water] for mosquitoes\nto breed.”"

That\nmeant that the state and local health department had to work with local sewer\nauthorities to adjust.\n\n\"There were also concerns around identifying appropriate funding sources for the\nexpenses and data-sharing agreements between the (local health departments) and\nlaboratories, in addition to validating the assay,\" Wuth said.\n\n\"The process ended up being far more logistically complex than MDHHS had\noriginally anticipated, but that was also part of the reason why CDC asked MDHHS\nto stand up a site. CDC wanted to evaluate how rapid sampling could be stood up\nfor this pathogen and what the complicating factors were. MDHHS’ stand-up of\npoliovirus wastewater testing helped contribute to the national understanding of\nthe potential barriers.\"\n\nWastewater samples dating to March 2023 will be screened for the virus.\n\nWuth couldn't answer questions from the Free Press about which communities in\nOakland County are included in the wastewater testing, how they were chosen or\nwhere the sampling site is located.\n\n\nWHAT IS POLIO?\n\nPolio is a virus that killed and crippled thousands of children in the 1940s and\n'50s. It spreads through person-to-person contact and can affect a person’s\nbrain or spinal cord, causing paralysis or even death.\n\nThird grader Frank Steinberger receives a shot during a polio vaccine trial at a\nMichigan school in April 1954. Some students received a placebo shot of\ndistilled water.\n\n“Polio is a debilitating disease that is preventable by safe and effective\nvaccines,” Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, said in\na statement. “Monitoring for polio in wastewater allows us to participate in\nleading technology that helps inform of potential risk, while vaccination also\nkeeps our communities safe.”\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF POLIO?\n\nPolio can spread silently through communities before anyone knows it's there.\nThat's because most people who catch the virus don't have any symptoms. For 25%\nof people, symptoms are flulike and can include: \n\n * Sore throat\n * Fever\n * Exhaustion\n * Headache\n * Nausea\n * Stomachache\n\nIt's the severe cases that can be devastating. Anywhere from 1 to 5 in 100\npeople can develop meningitis from a polio infection. That can cause potentially\nlife-threatening swelling of the brain or the lining around the spinal\ncord, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n[https://www.cdc.gov/polio/what-is-polio/index.htm].\n\nA smaller proportion of people are paralyzed by the virus, which can lead to\npermanent disability and, in some cases, death.\n\nAn iron lung ward for polio victims.\n\n\nHOW MANY POLIO CASES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE U.S.?\n\nThe virus was thought to be eradicated in the United States until a case\nwas identified in summer 2022\n[https://health.ny.gov/press/releases/2022/2022-08-01_polio.htm] in a man from\nRockland County, New York.

The\nRockland County case is only the second in the U.S. since 1979 with\nknown community transmission of poliovirus, according to a CDC report\n[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7133e2.htm?s_cid=mm7133e2_w] published\nin August.\n\nThe U.S. is now once again considered a country with circulating poliovirus.\n\n\nHOW CAN I PROTECT MYSELF AND LOVED ONES FROM POLIO?\n\nUnvaccinated people are vulnerable to contracting poliovirus as are people who\ndidn't complete the full vaccine series — four doses given between the ages of 2\nmonths and 6 years old.

        "content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAntibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria poses a fundamental threat to human\nhealth. It is well established that antibiotic use is associated with the\nemergence of resistance1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR1],2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR2]. However, the\nwithin-host drivers of resistance remain poorly understood, making it difficult\nto predict the emergence of resistance at the scale of individual patients3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR3],4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR4],5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR5]. This is an\nimportant problem to address, as resistant infections are associated with worse\noutcomes for patients6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR6],7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR7].\n\nThe dominant model for the within-host emergence of resistance is that\nresistance evolves because of selection for novel alleles that are acquired in\nsitu by mutation or horizontal gene transfer4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR4],8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR8],9\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR9],10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR10],11\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR11],12\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR12]. An implicit\nassumption of this model is that hosts are colonized by clonal pathogen\npopulations that lack genetic variation due to bottlenecks that occur during\ntransmission8 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR8],13\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR13],14\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR14],15\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR15],16\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR16]. However, hosts\ncan also be colonized by multiple strains of the same pathogen species17\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR17],18\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR18],19\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR19],20\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR20],21\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR21],22\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR22]. Mixed strain\npopulations contain both novel genetic variation that is acquired in situ and\npre-existing variation that reflects differences between the co-colonizing\nstrains. A key concept from evolutionary biology is that this additional source\nof standing genetic variation in mixed strain populations should accelerate the\nevolutionary response to antibiotic treatment by increasing the genetic\ndiversity that selection acts on23\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR23],24\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR24],25\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR25]. This simple logic\npredicts that resistance will evolve rapidly in hosts colonized by diverse\npathogen populations.\n\nIn this paper, we test the hypothesis that resistance evolves rapidly in diverse\npopulations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that is an\nimportant cause of hospital-acquired infection, particularly in\nimmunocompromised and critically ill patients7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR7],26\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR26],27\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR27],28\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR28]. Pseudomonas can\ncause infections at a wide range of anatomical sites, but the biggest problem\nwith Pseudomonas comes from infections of the lung7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR7],28\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR28],29\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR29],30\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR30]. P. aeruginosa\nevolves resistance during infections at a very high rate compared to other\nESKAPE pathogens31\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR31], and resistance is\nan importance challenge for treating Pseudomonas infection7\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR7],31\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR31]. Previous studies\nhave shown that different strains of Pseudomonas can co-occur in the lungs of\npatients who suffer from chronic P. aeruginosa infection associated with cystic\nfibrosis and bronchiectasis21\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR21],22\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR22],32\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR32]. We tested the\nimpact of within-patient Pseudomonas diversity in ICU patients using samples\nthat were collected from ASPIRE-ICU, an observational trial of Pseudomonas\ninfection in European hospitals33\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR33].\n\nPatients who were enroled into the ASPIRE-ICU trial were screened for\nPseudomonas soon after admission to ICU and then at regular intervals\nthereafter. Clinical microbiology projects usually focus on the analysis of a\nsmall number of isolates per patient sample, making it difficult to assess the\nprevalence and importance of within-patient pathogen diversity. ASPIRE-ICU, on\nthe other hand, sampled Pseudomonas isolates in an unbiased manner (i.e. without\nrespect to resistance phenotype), and collected up to 12 randomly chosen\nisolates from all patient samples containing Pseudomonas. Most patients who were\nenroled in the trial spent only a short time in ICU, but longitudinal samples\nwere collected from some patients, making it possible to directly study the\nwithin-patient drivers of antibiotic resistance8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR8],34\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR34]. In this paper, we\nuse a combination of phenotypic assays (resistance phenotyping, growth rate) and\ngenomic analyses to quantify within-patient diversity and antibiotic resistance.\nUsing this approach we show that at least 1/3 of patients are colonized by\nmultiple Pseudomonas strains, and that resistance evolves rapidly in these\npatients due to selection for pre-existing resistant strains.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nGENOMIC DIVERSITY OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA\n\nTo characterize the diversity of P. aeruginosa within patients we sequenced the\ngenomes of 441 isolates that were collected from lower respiratory tract samples\nof 35 ICU patients from 12 hospitals (Fig. 1A\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig1]). The number of\npatients per hospital was very unevenly distributed, and ~50% (n = 17/35\npatients) of our patients were from a single hospital with a high Pseudomonas\ncolonization rate (Fig. 1B\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig1]) (Source data).\n\nFig. 1: Overview of patient cohort, methodology, and isolate dataset.\nfigure 1\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-39416-2/MediaObjects/41467_2023_39416_Fig1_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2/figures/1\n\nA Overview of sample collection.

Scale =\nnucleotide substitutions. The raw data is presented in the source data file.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2/figures/1]\n\nIn line with previous work35\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR35], we found that P.\naeruginosa has a non-epidemic clonal population structure, consisting of clearly\ndifferentiated Sequence Types (STs) that are separated by long branches (Fig. 1D\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig1]). The most prevalent\nST (ST235) segregated into three sub-lineages, which diversified prior to our\nsampling (Fig. 1E [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig1]).\nGiven this phylogeny, we considered STs and sub-lineages of ST235 to represent\nunique strains.\n\nThe majority of patients (n = 23/35) were colonized by a single strain (Fig. 1C\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig1]). However, ~1/3 of\npatients (n = 12/35) were colonized by multiple strains (Fig. 1C\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig1]). Most of the patients\nthat were colonized by multiple strains were from a single hospital with a high\nPseudomonas colonization rate (Fig. 1B\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig1]). However, the uneven\nsampling of patients across hospitals made it impossible to test for variation\nin the prevalence of mixed strain colonization across hospitals (Fig. 1B\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig1]). Previous work has\nfound evidence of mixed strain populations in chronic Pseudomonas infections21\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR21],32\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR32], suggesting that\nmixed strain populations may be found in patients with a long history of\nPseudomonas infection. However, the prevalence of mixed strain populations did\nnot differ between patients who tested positive for Pseudomonas on ICU admission\nversus those who were colonized in ICU, suggesting that high within-patient\ndiversity is not simply a consequence of chronic infection (unpaired two-tailed\nt-test; p = 0.9073) (Supplementary Table 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]).\n\nStrain diversity tended to be high in patients colonized by multiple strains\n(mean Simpson’s index = 0.37, st.dev = 0.15) (Fig. 1C\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig1]). This measure of\nwithin-patient diversity does not depend on the number of isolates sampled, but\nour estimate of the prevalence of mixed strain colonization should be treated as\nconservative, as our ability to detect rare strains was limited by the number of\nisolates sequenced per patient. For example, in patients with six sequenced\nisolates, the probability of detecting a rare strain present at a frequency of\n5% is only 26%, assuming a binomial sampling distribution. However, in patients\nwith >10 isolates, the probability of detecting a rare strain increases to above\n40%. We carried out rarefaction analysis of the mixed strain patient populations\nto estimate the power of our sampling to detect mixed strain populations. This\nshowed that with six isolates per sample (which is the median isolate number in\nour single strain patient samples), multiple strains are captured in >99% of the\nsubsamples for 8/9 mixed strain patients (Supplementary Fig. 1\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]).\n\n\nWITHIN-PATIENT DIVERSITY AND AMR\n\nTo understand the impact of within-patient diversity on antimicrobial resistance\n(AMR), we measured resistance of isolates to a panel of antibiotics including\nciprofloxacin, meropenem, gentamicin, aztreonam, ceftazidime and\npiperacillin/tazobactam using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays.\nThis panel included representatives of all of the major families of antibiotics,\nbut was biased towards β-lactam antibiotics due to their clinical relevance for\ntreating Pseudomonas infections36\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR36]. In total we\nmeasured the resistance of 441 isolates to six antibiotics (Fig. 1A\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig1]), generating a large\ndataset on the distribution of resistance phenotypes (Source data).\n\nMeasuring antibiotic resistance using MIC assays generates quantitative data on\nresistance. However, we chose to analyse the resistance of each isolate to each\nantibiotic as a binary trait (i.e. sensitive/resistant) for two reasons. First,\nthe selective impact of quantitative variation in MIC scores that are above the\nclinical breakpoint concentration is not clear, as pathogens may not encounter\nthese high antibiotic doses during treatment37\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR37]. Furthermore, some\nbacterial isolates were resistant to the maximal doses of antibiotic used in our\nsusceptibility assays, and in these cases the quantitative resistance score is\nundefined.\n\nFor approximately half the patients (n = 16/35) we obtained isolates from only a\nsingle patient sample. Isolates from these patients provide insights into\nwithin-host diversity, but they provided limited insights into evolutionary\ndrivers of AMR. To address this problem, we measured changes in resistance using\nisolates from samples that were collected from patients before and after\ntreatment with antibiotics that are active against P. aeruginosa (Fig. 2A\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig2]). This subset of 13\nlongitudinally sampled patients included patients with single strain (n = 7\npatients) and mixed-strain (n = 6 patients) Pseudomonas populations. The\nremaining 6 longitudinally sampled patients were not treated with antibiotics\nthat are active against P. aeruginosa between their sampling points.\nImportantly, the number of days between the initial and final sample did not\ndiffer between patients with single strain and mixed strain populations\n(unpaired two-tailed t-test; p = 0.3211) (Supplementary Table 2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]).\n\nFig. 2: Mixed strain populations accelerate the emergence of resistance.\nfigure 2\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-39416-2/MediaObjects/41467_2023_39416_Fig2_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2/figures/2\n\nA Resistance phenotyping of isolates from the subset of 13 longitudinally\nsampled patients that were treated with antibiotics that are active against\nPseudomonas. B Change in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant isolates in\npatients with single strain (blue) and mixed strain (orange) populations.\nResistance to six antibiotics was measured and the proportion of isolates that\nwere resistant to each antibiotic at each time point was calculated. Data are\npresented as mean values for the proportion of isolates that were resistant to\neach antibiotic for the first sampling point (initial prevalence) and the\ndifference between sampling points (change in prevalence), from a minimum of\nn = 5 isolates per patient (source data file). Error bars show the standard\nerror of initial resistance (x-axis; n = 6 antibiotics) and the change in\nresistance (y-axis; n = 6 antibiotics) across antibiotics. C Bars show the mean\n(+/−s.e.) change in the prevalence of resistant isolates in single strain (n = 7\npatients; blue) and mixed strain (n = 6 patients; orange) populations after\ncorrecting for the effect of initial resistance. Mixed strain populations were\nassociated with larger increases in resistance in response to antibiotic\ntreatment (main effect diversity, F1,52 = 15.03, P = 0.0003). The statistical\nmodel used to analyse this data is described in the methods and the model output\nis given in Supplementary Table 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]. The raw data is\npresented in the source data file.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2/figures/2]\n\nTo measure the response to antibiotic treatment, we calculated the change in the\nproportion of isolates that were resistant to each antibiotic over time for each\ncombination of patient and antibiotic. Measuring resistance to a panel of\nantibiotics allowed us to distinguish between direct responses to antibiotics\nthat were used in treatment and collateral changes in resistance to antibiotics\nthat were not used for treatment for each patient (Source data). Surprisingly,\ndirect responses to antibiotic treatment were not larger than collateral\nresponses, implying an overall tendency towards cross-resistance (main effect\nresponse type: F1,52 = 0.029, P = 0.86) (Supplementary Table 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]). Given this, our\nanalysis of changes in resistance in response to treatment included all\nantibiotics in our panel. An important implication of this approach is that we\nassumed that each combination of patient and antibiotic was an independent\nresponse.\n\nAntibiotics should impose strong selection for resistance in populations where\naverage levels of resistance are low. Consistent with this hypothesis,\nresistance increased rapidly in patients where the initial prevalence of\nresistant isolates was low (Fig. 2B\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig2]; main effect initial\nresistance, F1,52 = 32, P < 0.0001). Importantly, this effect of initial\nresistance did not depend on the diversity of the pathogen population (initial\nresistance*diversity interaction: F1,52 = 0.018, P = 0.894) (Supplementary\nTable 3 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]). Response\nto antibiotic treatment varied between patients, even after correcting for the\nimpact of initial resistance, implying that individual combinations of\nhost/pathogen/treatment played an important role in the evolution of resistance\n(nested effect of patient: F11,52 = 3.91, P = 0.0004) (Supplementary Table 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]). Crucially,\nincreases in resistance were ~20% larger in patients colonized by mixed strains\ncompared to single strains for any given level of initial resistance (Fig. 2C\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig2]; main effect\ndiversity, F1,52 = 15.03, P = 0.0003) (Supplementary Table 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]).\n\n\nDRIVERS OF RESISTANCE IN MIXED STRAIN INFECTIONS\n\nThe emergence of resistance in patients with mixed strain populations could be\ncaused by either selection for pre-existing resistant strains or selection for\nnovel variants. To test for selection on pre-existing strains, we simplified our\nantibiotic resistance phenotyping data by classifying each isolate as multi-drug\nresistant (MDR; resistant to 3 or more antibiotics) or non-MDR (Source data).\nThis is an appropriate measure of resistance due to the overall tendency towards\ncross-resistance, and using this metric simplifies subsequent analysis.\n\nExamining changes in the composition of mixed strain populations revealed that\nSTs that were associated with non-MDR isolates were repeatedly replaced by ST235\nand ST654 (Fig. 3A–F [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig3]).\nBoth of these strains are well-characterized and epidemiologically successful\nMDR strains of P. aeruginosa38\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR38] that are common in\nhospitals from south-eastern Europe39\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR39]. In 3/5 patients\nwhere resistance increased in response to treatment, the resistant strain was\nalready detected prior to treatment (Fig. 3A, C, D\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig3]). In patient 15\n(Fig. 3B [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig3]), the ST654\nresistant strain that was detected after antibiotic treatment was not sampled at\nthe initial time point. However, polymorphisms were found in the ST654 isolates\nthat were sampled after antibiotic treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]). Given the short\ntime interval between sampling (7 days) and the low rate of within-host\nevolution of P. aeruginosa in critically ill patients (10–20 SNPs/genome/year8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR8],34\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR34]), these\npre-existing polymorphisms provide good evidence that ST654 was present at a low\nfrequency prior to antibiotic treatment. In the remaining patient (Patient 8;\nFig. 3F [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig3]), 2 new ST235\nMDR strains were detected after antibiotic treatment. The low number of isolates\nof each of these strains (n = 2) made it difficult to test whether these strains\nwere present prior to antibiotic treatment. However, removing this patient from\nthe analysis did not alter any of our conclusions (Supplementary Table 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]).\n\nFig. 3: Resistance emerges due to selection for pre-existing resistant strains.\nfigure 3\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-39416-2/MediaObjects/41467_2023_39416_Fig3_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2/figures/3\n\nA–F Changes in the prevalence of MDR isolates (resistant to 3 or more\nantibiotics) and strain composition in longitudinally sampled patients with\nmixed strain populations. Percentage of MDR isolates is shown between the first\nand last sampling points. Colour blocks between these sampling points indicate\npatient antibiotic use. The inset pie charts show the proportion of STs at each\ntime point (inner ring), and the contribution of these STs to MDR (outer ring).\nEach inset pie chart is labelled with the day of sampling it corresponds to. A\nPatient 8, B Patient 15, C Patient 17, D Patient 10, E Patient 16, F Patient 18.\nG For these five mixed strain population patients where resistance increases, we\npartitioned the increases in the prevalence of MDR isolates into changes in ST\ncomposition and changes in multi-drug resistance within strains. Numbers\nindicate patient ID. The raw data is presented in the source data file.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2/figures/3]\n\nIn summary, antibiotic treatment of patients with mixed strain populations was\nclearly associated with selection for pre-existing resistant strains. One way to\nquantify this effect is to decompose the increase in the prevalence of MDR\nisolates in the 5 patients where resistance increased into changes in ST\ncomposition, which we assume to reflect pre-existing variation, and changes in\nthe prevalence of MDR within strains, which we assume reflect the impact of new\nvariants that were acquired during infection (Fig. 3G\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig3]). In 4/5 patients all\nof the increase in resistance was driven by changes in ST composition, and in\nthe remaining patient changes in ST composition accounted for close to 80% of\nthe increase in MDR (Fig. 3G\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig3]). Combining these data\nwe estimate that >90% of increase in MDR in patients with mixed strain\npopulations are driven by selection for pre-existing resistant strains. This\nvery clear result suggests that pathogen diversity is associated with the rapid\nemergence of resistance because diverse pathogen population are more likely to\ncontain pre-existing resistant strains, and not because diversity per se\naccelerates the emergence of resistance within strains.\n\n\nTESTING FOR DE NOVO RESISTANCE EVOLUTION\n\nTo directly estimate the impact of strain diversity on the de novo evolution of\nresistance, we tested for signatures of resistance acquisition using genomic\ndata from longitudinally sampled patients. The genetic basis of antimicrobial\nresistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is complex and multifactorial40\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR40],41\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR41],42\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR42],43\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR43],44\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR44]. Most clinically\nrelevant resistance mutations increase the expression of chromosomal resistance\ngenes, such as mutations in peptidoglycan biosynthesis genes (ampD, ampDh2, dab,\nmpl) that increase the expression of the chromosomal ampC β-lactamase, or nalD\nand mexR mutations that increase the expression of the MexAB-OprM and MexXY-Z\nmultidrug efflux pumps, respectively. Chromosomal mutations can also confer\nincreased resistance by altering antibiotic targets, such as gyrA and parC\nmutations that modify fluoroquinolone target sites. Finally, mutations can\nrestrict the entry of antibiotics into the cell, such as oprD mutations that\nprovide resistance to carbapenem antibiotics.\n\nTo test for the mutational evolution of resistance, we searched for\npolymorphisms in genes that have been implicated in resistance using a database\nconstructed by45 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR45].\nBecause this approach only includes known resistance genes, it provides a\nconservative estimate of the presence of resistance genes. For example, the\nability to predict resistance phenotypes based on known genomic resistance\ndeterminants is low for some antibiotics, such as meropenem, suggesting that\nimportant resistance genes remain to be discovered. We only considered\nwithin-host polymorphisms in this analysis under the assumption that these\nvariants reflect de novo mutations that arose following patient colonization. We\nmodelled the number of resistance polymorphisms for each patient/strain\ncombination with a negative binomial regression as a function of the infection\ntype (single-strain vs. mixed-strain) and the number of isolates sequenced to\naccount for variation in sampling intensity. There was no significant difference\nin the number of de novo resistance variants between single-strain and\nmixed-strain populations (Fig. 4A\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig4], Supplementary\nTable 4a [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]). As a\ncontrol, we also measured levels of genome-wide polymorphism i.e. other variants\nnot associated with resistance. Similarly, there was no significant effect on de\nnovo variants from the infection type, providing good evidence that de novo\nvariants arise at similar rates in both types of infection (Fig. 4B\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig4], Supplementary\nTable 4b [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]).\n\nFig. 4: Genomic drivers of resistance evolution within patients.\nfigure 4\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-39416-2/MediaObjects/41467_2023_39416_Fig4_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2/figures/4\n\nThe abundance of variants in A genes associated with antibiotic resistance and B\nall variants as a function of sampling depth (i.e. number of isolates) in single\nstrain (blue) and mixed strain (orange) patients. Each data point represents a\nunique combination of ST and patient. We modelled the number of variants with a\nnegative binomial regression accounting for the infection type, number of\nisolates, and a possible interaction between them (n.variants ~ infection\ntype*isolates). The number of isolates per ST was positively associated with\nincreased number of resistance variants (0.13 +/− 0.05 variants per additional\nisolate; z = 2.57, p = 0.01) and other variants (0.13 +/− 0.03; z = 4.17,\np < 0.001). There was no significant difference between STs from single strain\nand mixed strain patients in terms of A resistance variants or B genetic\ndiversity (Supplementary Table 4a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1], 4b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]). We excluded a\nsingle strain population with an exceptionally high number of resistance\nvariants (grey data point, see ‘Methods’), although including it did not change\nthis conclusion (Supplementary Table 4c\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1], 4d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]). The raw data is\npresented in the source data file.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2/figures/4]\n\nAlthough studies of resistance in Pseudomonas have tended to focus on mutational\nresistance, there is growing evidence that P. aeruginosa acquires mobile\nresistance genes, including extended spectrum β-lactamases, carbapenemases, and\naminoglycoside modifying enzymes44\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR44],46\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR46]. We tested for the\nacquisition of new resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer by\nsearching for increases in the prevalence of acquired resistance genes (again,\nusing the database from ref. 45\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR45]). We found no\nevidence for the acquisition of novel resistance suggesting that Pseudomonas\nacquires resistance genes at a low rate in the lung (see also ref. 47\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR47]).\n\n\nWITHIN-PATIENT DIVERSITY AND FITNESS TRADE-OFFS\n\nTrade-offs between antibiotic resistance and fitness play a key role in the\nstability of resistance within patients following antibiotic treatment.\nAntibiotic treatment often fails to eradicate sensitive cells8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR8],34\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR34],48\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR48], ensuring that\ncompetition between sensitive and resistant cells occurs following antibiotic\ntreatment. When resistance is associated with low fitness due to trade-offs,\ncompetition can lead to the loss of resistance8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR8],34\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR34], limiting the\nability of the population to adapt to future antibiotic treatment48\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR48].\n\nThe acquisition of antibiotic resistance by mutation is typically associated\nwith costs49 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR49],50\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR50], suggesting that\ntrade-offs should be common in patients where resistance has evolved due to\nselection for de novo resistance mutations. Over time, resistant lineages can\nevolve to offset the fitness costs of resistance by acquiring compensatory\nmutations51 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR51],52\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR52],53\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR53],54\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR54]. As such, we would\nexpect trade-offs between resistance and fitness to be weaker when resistance\nevolves by selection for pre-existing resistant strains that have had more\nopportunity to acquire compensatory mutations.\n\nThe most commonly used method to test for fitness costs associated with\nresistance is to measure growth rate in antibiotic-free culture medium49\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR49]. Culture medium\ndoes not replicate the physical and chemical complexity of host tissues and it\nlacks stressors that are likely to play an important role in vivo, such as\nhost-derived antimicrobials. In spite of these clear limitations, estimates of\ngrowth rate measured in culture medium are moderately well correlated with in\nvivo estimates of fitness from animal models (r = 0.81; ref. 49\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR49]), and there are\ncompelling examples showing that in vitro growth rate can predict fitness of P.\naeruginosa in critically ill patients from the ASPIRE-ICU study8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR8],34\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR34].\n\nTo test for costs of resistance, we measured the growth rate of isolates from\nall patients containing a mixture of MDR and non-MDR Pseudomonas isolates\n(Fig. 5A [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig5]; source data\nfile). This subset of patients included both single-strain (n = 6) and\nmixed-strain patients (n = 4) (Fig. 5B\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig5]). The MDR phenotype\nwas associated with reduced growth, demonstrating a trade-off associated with\nresistance(main effect MDR: F1,167 = 5.42, P = 0.021) (Fig. 5B\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig5]) (Supplementary\nTable 5 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]). In\ncontrast to our hypothesis, trade-offs were stronger in mixed strain populations\nthan in single strain populations (MDR*diversity interaction: F1,167 = 11.24;\nP = 0.0010) (Fig. 5B [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#Fig5])\n(Supplementary Table 5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]).\n\nFig. 5: Fitness trade-offs within patients.\nfigure 5\n[https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-39416-2/MediaObjects/41467_2023_39416_Fig5_HTML.png]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2/figures/5\n\nA Selection of 10 patients with both MDR and non-MDR isolates from the total\ncohort of 35 patients based on resistance phenotyping data.

Line colour corresponds to patient number as shown in key.\nMDR was associated with reduced growth rate (P = 0.021), and the trade-off\nassociated with MDR was strongest in mixed strain populations (P = 0.001). The\ndata from this assay was analysed using ANOVA (see ‘Methods’ for model details,\nand Supplementary Table 5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1] for model output)\nand the raw data are presented in the source data file.\n\nFull size image [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2/figures/5]\n\nHowever, the genetic basis of this trade-off is not clear. Successful MDR/XDR\nstrains of P. aeruginosa typically carry a suite of chromosomal resistance\nmutations and horizontally acquired resistance genes38\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR38],55\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR55] as opposed to the\nsmall number of SNPs in resistance genes found in patients colonized by a single\nstrain, and this asymmetry in resistance gene content could explain the large\ncosts associated with pre-existing resistant strains. Alternatively, the low\nfitness of pre-existing MDR strains could reflect fitness costs associated with\nother genes that are unrelated to antibiotic resistance per se.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nEvolutionary approaches are increasingly being used to understand and combat\nantibiotic resistance56\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR56],57\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR57],58\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR58],59\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR59], and an important\nchallenge for this field is to understand the within-host drivers of resistance3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR3],4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR4],5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR5],8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR8],34\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR34]. The key finding\nof this study is that resistance evolves rapidly in patients colonized by\ndiverse P. aeruginosa populations due to selection for pre-existing resistant\nstrains, demonstrating a clear link between within-host diversity and\nresistance. Conventional methods used in clinical microbiology labs are\nsystematically biased against the detection of pathogen diversity, making it\ndifficult to assess the importance of pre-existing diversity in resistance\nacross bacterial pathogens. The rate at which resistance evolves in patients\nvaries widely across pathogens60\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR60], and we speculate\nthat high levels of within-host diversity may explain why some pathogens, such\nas Pseudomonas, rapidly adapt to antibiotic treatment in patients60\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR60].\n\nWe also found evidence of mutations in genes that have previously been\nimplicated in resistance, and an outstanding challenge is to determine if these\npolymorphisms were present as standing genetic variation at the onset of\ntreatment (for example as a result of past antibiotic treatment) or if these\npolymorphisms arose as a result of spontaneous mutations during antibiotic\ntreatment48 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR48]. This\ncould be done using amplicon sequencing to quantify the abundance of resistance\npolymorphisms before and after treatment in DNA extracted from patient samples,\nor by using phylogenetic approaches to date the origin of resistance lineages8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR8],34\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR34]. Recent work has\nused amplicon sequencing to show how within-host P. aeruginosa diversity is\nlinked to lung disease progression in patients with cystic fibrosis61\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR61].\n\nTrade-offs between resistance and growth rate make it is challenging to\nunderstand how strains that vary in resistance can stably coexist within the\nsame patient over the long term. Therefore, we speculate that within-patient\ndiversity will be high in settings with a high infection rate due to recurrent\ncolonization11 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR11],22\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR22],32\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR32] or in patients\nwhere antibiotic exposure is variable across host tissues, allowing high and low\nresistance strains to coexist by occupying spatially distinct niches62\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR62],63\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR63]. A further\nchallenge will be to determine if mixed strain populations arise as a\nconsequence of single colonization events or by superinfection64\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR64]. For example,\ntransmissible strains of P. aeruginosa can superinfect patients, giving rise to\nhigh within-patient strain diversity in CF patients22\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR22],32\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR32],64\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR64],65\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR65]. Finally, it is\npossible that some medical conditions make it more likely for patients to be\ncolonized by multiple strains due to variation in susceptibility to bacterial\ncolonization.\n\nIn conclusion, our study underscores the importance of within-host bacterial\ndiversity for understanding AMR4\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR4],5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR5],8\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR8],10\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR10],66\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR66],67\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR67]. Using bacterial\nisolates to measure within-host diversity limited the number of patients that we\ncould include in this study and measuring bacterial diversity by sequencing DNA\nextracted directly from patient sample or from pools of isolates should make it\npossible to assess the link between diversity and AMR in larger cohorts of\npatients. Our findings suggest that measuring the diversity of pathogen\npopulations might make it possible to more accurately predict the likelihood of\ntreatment failure at the level of individual patients, in the same way that\nmeasurements of diversity in cancer cell populations have been informative for\npredicting the success of chemotherapy68\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR68],69\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR69].\n\n\nMETHODS\n\n\nCLINICAL DATA\n\nThe subjects were recruited as part of the observational, prospective,\nmulticentre European epidemiological cohort study ASPIRE-ICU (The Advanced\nunderstanding of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infections in\nEurope–Intensive Care Units, (NCT02413242 ClinicalTrials.gov)33\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR33]. This was\nconducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, in\naccordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act and local\nguidelines in the participating countries. The study protocol was approved by\nthe research ethics committee in each country or participating hospitals.\nWritten informed consent was obtained upon study enrolment from the participants\nor their legally accepted representative. Adult subjects were enroled between\nJune 2015 and October 2018 within 3 days after ICU admission. To be eligible the\npatients needed to be on mechanical ventilation at ICU admission and have an\nexpected length of hospital stay ≥48 h33\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR33]. Participants were\nfollowed through their ICU stay to assess the development of pneumonia. Data on\nantibiotic use in the two weeks preceding ICU admission and during the ICU stay\nwere reported. During ICU stay, lower respiratory tract samples were obtained\nthree times in the first week, two times in the three following weeks, on the\nday of diagnosis of protocol pneumonia and seven days after it. The demographic\nand clinical baseline characteristics of the 35 subjects included in this\nanalysis are given in Supplementary Table 6\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1].\n\n\nSAMPLE COLLECTION AND ISOLATION\n\nLower respiratory samples used in this study were collected within the\nASPIRE-ICU study33\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR33]. Untreated\nrespiratory samples were stored at −80 °C until shipment and further analysis at\nthe central lab at the University of Antwerp. The samples were blended\n(30,000 rpm, probe size 8 mm, steps of 10 s, max 60 s in total), diluted 1:1 v/v\nwith Lysomucil (10% Acetylcysteine solution) (Zambon S.A, Belgium) and incubated\nfor 30 min at 37 °C with 10 s vortexing every 15 min. Thereafter, quantitative\nculture was performed by inoculating 10-fold dilutions on CHROMID P. aeruginosa\nAgar and blood agar using spiral plater EddyJet (IUL, Spain). Plates were\nincubated at 37 °C for 24 h and CFU/mL was calculated. Plates without growth\nwere further incubated for 48 h and 72 h. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption\nIonization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to identify\nup to 12 P. aeruginosa colonies per sample, which were stored at −80 °C until\nshipment to the University of Oxford and further use.\n\n\nRESISTANCE PHENOTYPING\n\nAll P. aeruginosa isolates were grown from glycerol stocks on Luria-Bertani (LB)\nMiller Agar plates overnight at 37 °C. Single colonies were then inoculated into\nLB Miller broth for 18–20 h overnight growth at 37 °C with shaking at 225 rpm.\nOvernight suspensions were serial diluted to ~5 × 105 CFU/mL. Resistance\nphenotyping was carried out as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing\nvia broth microdilution as defined by EUCAST recommendations70\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR70],71\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR71], with the\nalteration of LB Miller broth for growth media and the use of P. aeruginosa PAO1\nas a reference strain. Antibiotics were assayed along the following 2-fold\ndilution series between: ciprofloxacin (0.125–16 µg/mL), aztreonam\n(1–128 µg/mL), ceftazidime (1–256 µg/mL), meropenem (0.25–64 µg/mL),\npiperacillin/tazobactam (2–256 µg/mL) and gentamicin (0.5–128 µg/mL). Growth\ninhibition was defined as OD595 < 0.200. We calculated a single biologically\nindependent MIC for each of the 441 P. aeruginosa isolates on each antibiotic\n(Source Data). When an isolate reached the measurable limit of the MIC assay\n(i.e. not inhibited at the highest concentration used), the MIC was recorded as\ndouble of the upper limit in the raw data file of MIC results (Source data). The\nnumber of resistance phenotypes was calculated as the number of MICs per isolate\nabove the following: ciprofloxacin (0.5 µg/mL), aztreonam (16 µg/mL),\nceftazidime (8 µg/mL), meropenem (8 µg/mL), piperacillin/tazobactam (16 µg/mL)\nand gentamicin (8 µg/mL). These points were set from EUCAST guidelines for\nPseudomonas (v11 breakpoint table, and MIC distributions for P. aeruginosa data\nfor gentamicin)71 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR71].\nMDR isolates were defined as isolates with 3 or more resistance phenotypes. For\nlongitudinally sampled patients treated with colistin (patient 6, patient 16,\npatient 18, patient 32, patient 35), the same protocol was used to determine\ncolistin MIC along the following 2-fold dilution series between: 0.5–64 µg/mL,\nand a colistin resistance phenotype was determined as an MIC above 2 µg/mL\n(Source data)71 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR71].\n\n\nSEQUENCING\n\nAll isolates were sequenced in the MiSeq or NextSeq illumina platforms yielding\na sequencing coverage of 21X–142X. Raw reads were quality controlled with the\nILLUMINACLIP (2:30:10) and SLIDINGWINDOW (4:15) in trimmomatic v. 0.39. Quality\ncontrolled reads were assembled for each isolate with SPAdes v. 3.13.1 with\ndefault parameters. These assemblies were further polished using pilon v. 1.23\nwith minimum number of flank bases of 10, gap margin of 100,000, and kmer size\nof 47. Resulting contigs were annotated based on the P. aeruginosa strain\nUCBPP-PA14 in prokka v. 1.14.0. Each isolate was typed using the Pseudomonas\naeruginosa multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme from PubMLST (Last accessed\non 11.06.2021). Sixteen isolates chosen randomly from the key STs were sequenced\nwith the Oxford nanopore MinION platform using the FLO-MIN106 flow-cell and the\nSQK-LSK109 kit. Raw reads were basecalled using guppy v. 0.0.0 + 7969d57 and\nreads were demultiplexed using qcat v. 1.1.0\n(https://github.com/nanoporetech/qcat [https://github.com/nanoporetech/qcat]).\nResulting sequencing reads were assembled using unicycler v. 0.4.872\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR72], which used\nSAMtools v. 1.973 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR73],\npilon v. 1.2374 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR74],\nand bowtie2 v. 2.3.5.175\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR75], in hybrid mode\nwith respective illumina reads.\n\nFor the rarefaction analysis of mixed strain patient samples the datasets were\nsubsampled 100X from size 2 to N-1, where N is the actual size of the sample,\nusing the standard random library of python v. 3.9.16. The null hypothesis that\nthe sampling is normally distributed was tested using the normaltest function\nfrom the script library76\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR76],77\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR77].\n\n\nVARIANT CALLING\n\nPaired-ended reads were mapped to the P. aeruginosa PAO1 reference genome\n(NC_002516.2) with Bowtie 2 v2.2.4, and pileup and raw files were obtained by\nusing SAMtools v0.1.16 and PicardTools v1.140, using the Genome Analysis Toolkit\n(GATK) v3.4-46 for realignment around InDels. From the raw files, SNPs were\nextracted if they met the following criteria: a quality score (Phred-scaled\nprobability of the samples reads being homozygous reference) of at least 50, a\nroot-mean-square (RMS) mapping quality of at least 25 and a coverage depth of at\nleast 3 reads, excluding all ambiguous variants. MicroInDels were extracted from\nthe totalpileup files when meeting the following criteria: a quality score of at\nleast 500, a RMS mapping quality of at least 25 and support from at least\none-fifth of the covering reads78\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR78]. Filtered files\nwere converted to vcf and SNPs and InDels were annotated with SnpEff v4.2.79\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR79]. Gene absence was\nevaluated using SeqMonk\n(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/\n[https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/]) and OprD\nstructural integrity was investigated within the de novo assemblies using an\nappropriate reference sequence. Finally, all mutations within a set of genes\nknown to be involved in antibiotic resistance were extracted and natural\noccurring polymorphisms were filtered45\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR45]. The presence of\nhorizontally acquired antimicrobial resistance determinants was also\ninvestigated using the web tool ResFinder\n(https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ResFinder/\n[https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ResFinder/]).\n\nTo identify mutations and gene gain/loss during the infection, short-length\nsequencing reads from each isolate were mapped to each of the four long-read de\nnovo assemblies with bwa v. 0.7.17 using the BWA-MEM algorithm. Preliminary SNPs\nwere identified with SAMtools and BCFtools v. 1.9. Low-quality SNPs were\nfiltered out using a two-step SNP calling pipeline, which first identified\npotential SNPs using the following criteria: (1) Variant Phred quality score of\n30 or higher, (2) At least 150 bases away from contig edge or indel, and (3) 20\nor more sequencing reads covering the potential SNP position. In the second\nstep, each preliminary SNP was reviewed for evidence of support for the\nreference or the variant base; at least 80% of reads of Phred quality score of\n25 or higher were required to support the final call. An ambiguous call was\ndefined as one with not enough support for the reference or the variant, and, in\ntotal, only one non-phylogenetically informative SNP position had ambiguous\ncalls. Indels were identified by the overlap between the HaplotypeCaller of GATK\nv. 4.1.3.0 and breseq v. 0.34.0. The variable genome was surveyed using GenAPI\nv. 1.098 based on the prokka annotation of the short-read de novo assemblies.\nThe presence or absence of genes in the potential variable genome was reviewed\nby mapping the sequencing reads to the respective genes with BWA\nv.0.7.17.SNPs/indels. A maximum parsimony phylogeny was constructed based on\nhigh-confidence SNPs to illustrate the genetic diversity of isolates recovered\nfrom patient 15 (Supplementary Fig. 2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]). Phylogenies were\nplotted with iTOL80\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR80].\n\n\nGROWTH ASSAYS\n\nAll isolates were grown from glycerol stocks on LB Miller Agar plates overnight\nat 37 °C. Single colonies were then inoculated into LB Miller broth for 18–20 h\novernight growth at 37 °C with shaking at 225 rpm. Overnight suspensions were\nserially diluted to an OD595 of ~0.05 and placed within the inner 60 wells of a\n96-well plate equipped with a lid. To calculate growth rate, isolates were then\ngrown in LB Miller broth at 37 °C and optical density (OD595nm) measurements\nwere taken at 10-min intervals in a BioTek Synergy 2 microplate reader set to\nmoderate continuous shaking. Growth rate was then calculated as the maximum\nslope of OD versus time over an interval of ten consecutive readings, and at\nleast three biologically independent replicate cultures were measured for all of\nthe pulmonary isolates to calculate the mean growth rate of each isolate (Source\ndata).\n\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nFor each patient sample, we calculated the proportion of isolates that were\nresistant to each antibiotic as described above70\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR70],71\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR71]. Changes in\nresistance for each antibiotic were measured as the difference in proportion of\nresistant isolates between the final and initial sample for longitudinally\nsampled patients (Source data), giving a total of 6 responses per patient (i.e.\n1 response per antibiotic/patient combination). Although the proportions of\nisolates that were resistant to antibiotics were not normally distributed,\nchanges in the proportion of resistant isolates were normally distributed. To\ntest drivers of antibiotic resistance we used an ANOVA that included main\neffects of initial proportion of resistant isolates (continuous variable, 1DF),\nantibiotic (5 DF), pathogen diversity (single strain or mixed strain; 1DF) and\nresponse type (direct or collateral, 1DF. We nested patient within pathogen\ndiversity (11DF). We included an interactions between initial proportion of\nresistant isolates and pathogen diversity (1DF) and initial resistance and\nantibiotic (1DF). Non-significant terms were then sequentially removed to yield\na reduced model containing only significant effects (Supplementary Table 3\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]).\n\nThe number of observed de novo variants for each ST/patient combination\n(n.variants) can be treated as a count variable. Because of overdispersion we\nused a negative binomial regression using the glm.nb function in the “MASS” R\npackage v7.3-5581 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#ref-CR81].\nWe controlled for single vs. mixed infections (infection.type) and number of\nsequenced isolates per ST (isolates.per.ST) using the model formula:\nn.variants ~ infection.type*isolates.per.ST. We ran separate models for\nresistance-associated variants (Supplementary Table 4a\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]) and all other\nvariants (Supplementary Table 4b\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]). In both models,\nthe only significant association was with the number of sequenced isolates\n(p < 0.05 for both). This analysis excluded one outlier from a single-strain\npatient (isolate 25-0925) where we found many polymorphic deletions in genes\nassociated with antibiotic efflux. However, including the outlier did not change\nthe conclusion that infection type had no significant effect (Supplementary\nTable 4c [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1], 4d\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]).\n\nFitness costs were assessed by comparing the growth rate of co-occurring MDR\n(i.e. 3 or more resistance phenotypes) and non-MDR (i.e. 0-2 resistance\nphenotypes) lung isolates from the same patient. We considered all patients with\nmultiple (i.e. >1) MDR and non-MDR isolates in this analysis, giving a total of\n179 isolates from 10 patients (Source data). To understand the sources of\nvariation in fitness, we used an ANOVA that included main effects of resistance\nphenotype (i.e. MDR or non-MDR; 1DF), pathogen diversity (single strain or mixed\nstrain; 1DF) and patient nested within pathogen diversity (8DF). We tested for\nvariation in fitness trade-offs between single strain and mixed strain\npopulations by including a resistance phenotype*pathogen diversity interaction\nin the model. The full statistical model is presented in Supplementary Table 5\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM1]. JMP v.12 was used\nfor statistical analysis.\n\n\nREPORTING SUMMARY\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39416-2#MOESM2]\nlinked to this article.\n\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY\n\nThe source data have been deposited in the Oxford Research Archive for Data\n(https://doi.org/10.5287/ora-mzzd1qykn [https://doi.org/10.5287/ora-mzzd1qykn]).\nIsolates can be obtained from the corresponding author for research use via an\nMTA subject to permission from the ASPIRE research committee.

        "content": "When you go on a diet, you don't just lose fat – you lose muscle too. This can\nhave many repercussions – not only on your fitness and strength, but on your\nmetabolism.\n\nTo lose weight (body fat), you need to be in a calorie deficit. This means\nconsuming fewer calories than your body uses, or exercising to burn more\ncalories than you consume.\n\nDuring the first few days in a calorie deficit, the body uses up its small\nreservoir of glycogen stores [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1615908/] for\nenergy. Glycogen is a string of glucose (sugar) that comes from the\ncarbohydrates you eat.\n\nSince carbs are the body's main energy source, this is why any glucose the body\ndoesn't immediately use is stored to use for energy later.\n\nBut as carbohydrate molecules bind with water, this means that when the body\nstores glycogen, it also stores water in the muscles. As these glycogen stores\nare used up, the body also releases a significant amount of water.\n\nThis is often called \"water weight\", and explains why some may feel they lose\nconsiderable weight early in their diet.\n\nGiven you only have days' worth of glycogen stores, this is why the body uses\nfat to store extra calories for when you need it. Once the glycogen stores are\nused up, the body shifts to metabolizing fat to get the energy it needs to\nfunction.\n\nBut not all tissues can use fat for energy – such as the brain. This is why the\nbody needs to metabolize your muscles when you're in a calorie deficit.\n\nProtein (from the food you eat) is stored in your muscles. The body can convert\nthis stored protein into glucose for energy. But this means you subsequently\nlose the muscle tissue itself when that happens.\n\nThis has significant consequences – including slowing the metabolism\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35103583/], which may ultimately drive weight\nregain after losing weight.\n\n\nMUSCLE LOSS\n\nMany factors can affect how much muscle you lose while in a calorie deficit.\n\nWhile it was once thought that the more fat you had, the less muscle you lost\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10673906/] in a calorie deficit, this has since\nbeen disproved – with both lean [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3066619/] and\nobese people [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17367567/] losing significant\nrates of muscle when dieting.\n\nEthnicity [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29957829/] and genetics\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734691/] may, however, play a role – with\nstudies showing Black people tend to lose more muscle mass in a calorie deficit\nthan White people do.\n\nSome research also suggests that genetic variants may make some people more\nsusceptible to certain dietary changes\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734691/], which may determine how much muscle\nmass they end up losing.\n\nMuscle loss will also happen regardless of whether you lose weight gradually or\nquickly [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30925026/]. A better determinant of how\nmuch muscle you'll lose depends on how much weight you end up losing\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30925026/].\n\nIf a person loses 10% of their body weight, typically around 20% of this is\nfat-free mass (the proportion of body mass that isn't fat – such as muscle).\nThis can equate to several kilograms of muscle.\n\nMany people also think that what you eat while losing weight may determine how\nmuch muscle you lose, with it commonly believed that if you eat plenty of\nprotein you're less likely to lose muscle mass.\n\nThis is debatable [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19246357/], with research\nshowing people lose as much muscle on high-protein weight loss diets as people\nwho followed other types of diets.\n\nLow-carb diets have also been claimed to promote more fat loss. But studies\ncomparing different types of diets [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22258266/]\nhave found that low-fat high-carb diets seem to offer the same, if not better,\nfat loss [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28193517/] than low-carb, high-fat\ndiets – with no differences in muscle loss.\n\n\nPROTEIN AND EXERCISE\n\nGiven all that has been said, the only way to prevent muscle loss somewhat while\nlosing weight is to combine exercise (particularly resistance exercise\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18356845/] and endurance exercise\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28507015/]) with a diet higher in protein.\n\nThis is because exercise stimulates muscle growth – but this process can only\nhappen if you have an adequate supply of protein.\n\nIt's suggested adults normally aim to consume 0.8 g of protein per kilogram of\nbody weight [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34371981/] per day to maintain\nmuscle mass. But given the extra demand exercise places on the muscles, a person\nwill probably need to consume 1.2-1.5 g of protein per kilogram of body weight\nto preserve muscle during weight loss.\n\nPeople who exercise a lot may need to increase that to more than 2g per kilogram\nof body weight [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28642676/] when losing weight.\nOlder people [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22221216/] may also need to\nconsume more protein than average.\n\nJust be wary of consuming too much protein (more than 2. 5g\n[https://www.sciencealert.com/5g] per kilogram of body weight) as eating more\nthan your body uses could have an adverse effect\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28507015/] on your metabolism by potentially\nmaking the body less able to draw upon glucose for energy.\n\nIt may also put greater pressure on the kidneys and liver – which could lead to\nserious health issues\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7460905/#:%7E:text=High%20dietary%20protein%20intake%20can,a%20role%20in%20kidney%20health.],\nsuch as liver and kidney damage.\n\nEven if you prevent muscle loss when losing weight, other metabolic changes\nstill happen that promote weight regain – such as changes in your metabolic rate\n(the minimum amount of calories your body needs to survive) and increases in\nappetite and hunger [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21677272/].\n\nThis is why, when trying to lose weight, the most important thing to consider is\nhow sustainable your diet and lifestyle changes are. The easier these are to\nmaintain, the better chances you have of keeping the weight off.The Conversation\n[https://counter.theconversation.com/content/209258/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic]\n\nAdam Collins [https://theconversation.com/profiles/adam-collins-1179004],\nPrincipal Teaching Fellow, Nutrition, University of Surrey\n[https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-surrey-1201]\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation [https://theconversation.com/]\nunder a Creative Commons license.

And\nthat’s understandable. Belly fat is really easy to gain and notoriously hard to\nlose. It can seem as though no matter what exercises you try to lose belly fat\nand no matter how well you eat, the belly fat just won’t budge.”\n\nMarcus Filly knows how to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time 5 Old School\nAbs Exercises You Should Still be Doing The Best Exercise to Lose Belly Fat for\nGood\n[https://image.boxrox.com/2021/10/Marcus-Filly-Surprising-Fat-Loss-Mistakes-1024x576.png]\n\n“And unfortunately, with exception to surgery, there is currently no proven\nmethod of being able to spot reduce fat from the belly. There is an exercise,\nhowever, that is incredibly underutilized yet powerfully effective when it comes\nto losing even the most stubborn belly fat. Today I’ll share what that is and\nhow you can start using it right away to lose belly fat.”\n\n\nWHY IS BELLY FAT SO HARD TO LOSE?\n\n“Why is belly fat so hard to lose in the first place? Well, it comes down to the\nfact that certain areas of your body are easier to lose fat than others, and is\nlargely determined by genetics. Now having your genetics stacked against you may\nseem problematic if you’re looking to develop a slim or lean looking abdomen,\nbut there is a solution. As long as you create a calorie deficit, you will\ncontinue to lose fat. Eventually, if maintained long enough, you will lose\nexcess fat from all areas of your body, even if your genetics put your belly fat\nat the back of the line.”\n\n\nHOW TO BE CONSISTENT\n\n“While diet should be your main way of creating a calorie deficit, adding\nadditional exercises could help you to lose belly fat by keeping your metabolism\nhigh, even as you’re losing weight from dieting. That said, not all exercises\nare created equal. While things like running, rowing, cycling, or even HIIT\nworkouts tend to burn calories very quickly, the truth is, the overwhelming\nmajority of people can’t actually stick with traditional cardio long enough for\nfat loss to reach stubborn areas. And it’s not that these methods don’t work if\nyou stick to it, because they do. The problem is simply that they’re brutal.\nThey require a lot of willpower.”\n\n\nTYPES OF CARDIO\n\n“Now don’t get me wrong, these forms of cardio definitely do have their place\nand some people have no problem sticking to them. In fact, I still do these\nintense sessions once or twice a week for conditioning. But I no longer rely on\nthem as my main form of cardio to lose fat and nor should most people. Because\nif you want to lose your stubborn belly fat, and more importantly keep it off\nonce it’s gone, then you need something you can stick to for life. What’s the\nsolution?”\n\n\nTHE BEST EXERCISE\n\n“The best exercise to lose belly fat is walking. It’s the easiest to maintain,\nlowest stress, lowest fatigue, and most versatile form of cardio. According to\nresearch, intense forms of cardio like HIIT or running, while time efficient,\ndidn’t provide any superior fat loss effect when compared to longer yet less\nintense forms of cardio such as walking. Which makes sense. It’s simply a\nnumbers game. Your body doesn’t care whether the calories you burned were from\nsome crazy intense fasted cardio session or from plain old walking. What matters\nmost is what you can do consistently over time. And if you crunch the numbers,\nyou’ll actually find that the calories burned from simply walking can very\nquickly add up to a meaningful amount.”\n\nabs exercises [https://image.boxrox.com/2019/05/katrin-1.png]\n\n\nEXACTLY HOW TO LOSE THE FAT\n\n“So now that I’ve hopefully convinced you of the power of walking, let’s dive\ninto the specifics of how to lose belly fat from walking. The first step is to\ndetermine an average of how many steps you’re currently taking. You can use the\nhealth app on your iPhone or use Google Fit if you’re on Android. After a week,\nsee what your daily average comes up to. Some of you however might be surprised\nwith how few steps you’re taking, but this is a good thing, as it means you have\na big opportunity to bump that up.”\n\n\nREALISTIC GOALS\n\n“Set a realistic goal and first aim to do an extra 2,000 steps a day. Given that\nthe average individual takes about 1,200 steps during 10 minutes of walking, all\nyou have to do is throw in two 10 minutes walks into your day to accomplish\nthat. Once you’re consistent with that, try bumping it up by another 2,000\nsteps, and continue doing this with the goal of consistently getting at least\n8,000 steps or even up to 15,000 steps, which seems to be the range that\nprovides the greatest fat loss and health benefits.”\n\n\nIT ALL ADDS UP\n\n“Trust me, the little things add up. Apply these tips and you’ll be surprised\nwith just how much they increase your step count and even more surprised by how\nmuch of a difference it makes towards your fat loss overtime. That said guys, I\nwant to emphasize that walking or any form of cardio is only effective for fat\nloss if it’s used in combination with a diet. So use your diet as the primary\nway to create a calorie deficit and supplement it with walking to help speed up\nthe process.”\n\n\nVIDEO – THE BEST EXERCISE TO LOSE BELLY FAT FOR GOOD\n\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nHow to Increase Chest Size and Strength\n[https://www.boxrox.com/how-to-increase-chest-size-and-strength-3/]\n\nBest Way to Train the Chest for Hypertrophy (Muscle Mass)\n[https://www.boxrox.com/the-best-way-to-train-the-chest-for-hypertrophy-muscle-mass-2/]\n\n3 Hacks for a Bigger Chest [https://www.boxrox.com/3-hacks-for-a-bigger-chest/]\n\nUpper Chest Exercises Ranked (Best to Worst)\n[https://www.boxrox.com/upper-chest-exercises-ranked-best-to-worse/]\n\n9 Best Dumbbell Chest Exercises\n[https://www.boxrox.com/9-best-dumbbell-chest-exercises/]\n\n\nMUSCLES OF THE LEGS\n\nThe muscles of the legs are responsible for locomotion and balance. They are\ngrouped into two categories: extensors and flexors.\n\n\nTHE BEST EXERCISE TO LOSE BELLY FAT FOR GOOD – GASTROCNEMIUS\n\nThe gastrocnemius [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrocnemius_muscle] is a\ntwo-headed muscle with origins on the lateral condyle of the femur and on the\nposterior surface of the calcaneus. It inserts into the posterior surface of\nproximal phalanges through an aponeurosis. The gastrocnemius acts to plantar\nflex at both knee and ankle joints, as well as inversion at ankle joint when\nstanding upright.\n\n\nTHE BEST EXERCISE TO LOSE BELLY FAT FOR GOOD – QUADRICEPS\n\nThe quadriceps (quads) are muscles in the thigh that attach to the patella, or\nkneecap. They extend the leg at the knee and flex (bend) it at the hip. The\nquadriceps are considered to be one of the strongest muscles in your body and\nhelp support you during walking, running, jumping and other weight-bearing\nactivities.\n\n\nTHE BEST EXERCISE TO LOSE BELLY FAT FOR GOOD – HAMSTRINGS\n\nThe hamstring muscles are a group of three muscles on the back of your thigh.\nThey bend your knee and extend your hip.\n\nHamstring muscle contractions are important for walking, running, jumping,\nkicking and maintaining balance.\n\n\nTHE BEST EXERCISE TO LOSE BELLY FAT FOR GOOD – SOLEUS\n\nThe soleus is a muscle in the back of your lower leg. It lies deep to the\ngastrocnemius, and like its more superficial counterpart, it has two heads:\nmedial and lateral. The soleus is responsible for plantar flexion of the ankle\njoint and contributes to knee extension. It also helps stabilize your body when\nyou stand on one leg.\n\nThe tibial nerve innervates this muscle from its posterior division; thus, there\nis no motor branch joining them together at any point.\n\n\nTHE BEST EXERCISE TO LOSE BELLY FAT FOR GOOD – PLANTARIS\n\nThe plantaris is a small muscle in the back of the leg that attaches to the\nlower part of the knee. It is not used much in everyday life, but it can be\ninjured during sports activities.\n\nThe plantaris originates from several tendons and muscles around your knee,\nincluding some parts of your hamstring and calf muscles.\n\nThese tendons and other tissues all come together to form a single tendon that\ntravels down through your lower leg to attach at the bone just under your ankle\njoint (medial malleolus). The muscle fibres then extend out toward your toes on\neach side.\n\n\nTHE BEST EXERCISE TO LOSE BELLY FAT FOR GOOD – POPLITEUS\n\nThe popliteus is a small muscle that lies on the back of the knee. It is located\nat the bottom of your thighbone and helps to flex your knee.\n\nIt also stops your shinbone from rotating while you’re running, which helps\nprotect your kneecap (patella). This muscle can get injured if you do sudden or\nextreme movements with your legs, such as kicking something or falling onto one\nfoot.\n\nThe popliteus is used in sports such as football, basketball and tennis because\nit allows players to change direction quickly without having to slow down first.\nInjuries are rare but they can happen during certain activities like dancing or\nmartial arts when there are lots of twists and turns involving fast movements\nwith one leg up in front.\n\n\nGRACILIS\n\nThe gracilis is a slender muscle that originates on the medial epicondyle of the\nfemur and on an intermuscular septum between gracilis and adductor longus. It\ninserts at the medial side of the pectineal line of the pubis.\n\nThe gracilis is responsible for flexion, adduction, and medial rotation of your\nleg.\n\n\nSARTORIUS\n\nThe Sartorius is a muscle of the anterior thigh and is one of the longest\nmuscles in the body. It flexes and rotates the thigh laterally, and it also\nstabilizes flexion at the knee by preventing rotation of leg.\n\nThe Sartorius originates from the lateral ilium, sacrum (at first functionally\nconnected to sacroiliac joint), and posterior surface of femur; its insertion\n(into tensor fascia lata) can be found on anteromedial aspect of tibia, along\nwith semitendinosus.\n\nThis long muscle runs from hip to knee and inserts into tibia as well as fibula\nvia its innervation by nerve plexus around femoral vessels near inguinal\nligament.\n\n\nSEMIMEMBRANOSUS\n\nThe semimembranosus is one of the three hamstring muscles. It is located on the\nback of the thigh, behind and below its larger counterpart, the semitendinosus.\nThe hamstring group serves to extend or straighten your hip joint while flexing\nand rotating your knee joint inward (towards your other leg).\n\nSome of these functions are obvious when you look at a person standing up\nstraight: when they bend forward, their knees flex; but if they twist in one\ndirection or another as well, it’s usually because their hamstrings have rotated\ntheir legs in those directions too.\n\n\nSEMITENDINOSUS\n\nThe semitendinosus muscle is a member of the hamstring group and originates from\nthe ischial tuberosity, also known as the sit bone. The semitendinosus muscle\ninserts onto the head of the fibula bone. It acts to flex and extend (bend\nforward) your knee joint.\n\nThe tibial nerve innervates this muscle, with branches of its posterior division\nsupplying it through a branch called L5. Two blood vessels supply it: the deep\nposterior circumflex femoral artery from above and lateral circumflex femoral\nartery from below.\n\n\nBICEPS FEMORIS\n\n * Origin: Ischial tuberosity, posterior surface of the body of femur, and upper\n   portion of the intermuscular septum between vastus intermedius and vastus\n   medialis.\n * Insertion: Head of fibula.\n * Action: Knee flexion (leg bending).\n * Innervation: Tibial nerve (L5-S2).\n * Blood supply: Deep artery in the anterior tibial recurrent branch via\n   perforating branch to reach muscle belly; branches from anterior tibial\n   artery supply lower third; perforating branch supplies upper two-thirds.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe muscles of the leg are very important to our body and its ability to move.\nWithout them, we wouldn’t be able to walk or run. They are also responsible for\nhelping us stand up straight and stable when standing still which is why it’s\nimportant to stretch all these muscles regularly if you want strong legs!"

And this effect remained even after adjusting for\nknown cardiovascular risk factors and other social determinants of health.\n\nThe researchers said their findings \"underline the important fact that, despite\nimprovements in public health, access to care-;and citizen health in the United\nStates overall-;significant gaps exist between communities, and progress has not\nbeen uniform across all neighborhoods.\"\n\nThey added that, \"while thought-provoking and hypothesis-generating,\" the data\ndoesn't explain what caused such higher rates of cardiovascular issues in\nredlined areas.\n\n\"Historical residential policies, such as redlining, may have a long-lasting\neffect on community health,\" Al-Kindi said. \"This study builds on emerging\nliterature linking redlining with a host of present-day health issues.\"\n\n\"Our nationwide study demonstrates that a century-old practice like redlining\nstill affects our nation's health today,\" Deo said. \"Future studies should aim\nto better define the reasons for the observed relationships between\nintergenerational inequities and cardiovascular health.

        "content": "Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes\n\nMURRAY — For decades, very little has been known about treating acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia and sepsis — but that might be set to\nchange.\n\n\"The reality is that ARDS and pneumonia and sepsis, which are pretty similar\nsyndromes, are really like bananas and oranges and apples and papayas and guavas\nand we've just been treating them all as if they were a fruit and what works for\napples ought to work for the rest,\" said Dr. Samuel Brown, vice president for\nresearch and research professor at Intermountain Health.\n\nIntermountain Health on Tuesday announced that it has been selected as one of\nsix core health care systems from a larger group of 22 hospitals across the\ncountry, and a clinical coordinating center at the Vanderbilt University Medical\nCenter, to lead a national effort to improve treatment for patients with acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia and sepsis — the most common and\ndebilitating conditions found in critically ill patients.\n\nTogether, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia and sepsis kill\nhundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. each year. Acute respiratory\ndistress syndrome and sepsis are most often caused by pneumonia, which is a\nsyndrome itself, with poor results: up to 50% mortality rate, and for survivors\nthere's often a reduced quality of life and an ongoing risk for early death,\naccording to a press release from Intermountain Health.\n\nThe federally funded initiative will provide a $51.6 million grant from the\nNational Institutes of Health for the hospitals to gather information about\n5,000 patients across the country to better understand what's happening to them\nduring and after the illnesses.\n\n\"What we're really trying to do is identify, 'What are these meaningful subtypes\nof these big syndromes so that we can get specific treatments to people,'\" Brown\nsaid. \"A lot of us are very optimistic that this will be the crucial next step\nin finding potential effective treatments for these devastating illnesses.\"\n\nThe Kem C.

We'll learn about what's happening to them in\nthe hospital or an intensive care unit,\" Brown said, adding that researchers\nwill study patients by collecting information on them through assessments like\nblood and genetic tests.\n\n\"We want to make sure that we understand not only what determines whether you\nlive or die from the acute illness, but for those who are fortunate enough to\nsurvive, what are the right ways to work with them to maximize their health and\nflourishing as they survive,\" he added.\n\nAdditionally, the initiative will utilize advanced technologies such as\nartificial intelligence\n[https://www.ksl.com/news/stream/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt] and machine\nlearning to improve patient treatment. Specifically, AI can be harnessed to\nidentify patterns who otherwise wouldn't be identified — a function that\nIntermountain Health and the rest of the health care systems will be leaning\ninto.\n\nDr. Samuel Brown, vice president for research at Intermountain Health, talks in\nMurray about Intermountain Health being selected as one of six health systems in\nthe U.S. to lead a national effort to improve patient outcomes for the most\ncommon conditions found in critically ill patients, at a press conference on\nTuesday.\n[https://img.ksl.com/slc/2938/293828/29382802.jpeg?filter=kslv2/inline_lg]\nDr. Samuel Brown, vice president for research at Intermountain Health, talks in\nMurray about Intermountain Health being selected as one of six health systems in\nthe U.S. to lead a national effort to improve patient outcomes for the most\ncommon conditions found in critically ill patients, at a press conference on\nTuesday.

This editorial was written on behalf of the\nboard by Star Tribune Opinion intern Noor Adwan, a 2023 graduate of the\nUniversity of Minnesota.\n\n•••\n\nIn what health experts have described as a needed step forward in medicine,\nadults over 60 will be able to be vaccinated this fall against RSV, a virus that\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates to cause between\n60,000–160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000–10,000 deaths among older Americans\nper year through respiratory illness.\n\nCDC Director Rochelle Walensky's June 29 endorsement\n[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/s0629-rsv.html] of the Advisory\nCommittee on Immunization Practices' recommendations regarding the vaccine marks\nthe end of a decadeslong initiative to make such protections available against\nthe virus, which made headlines last year when a \"tripledemic\" of RSV, flu and\nCOVID-19 infections overwhelmed hospitals nationwide.\n\n\"It's really an exciting thing to have available,\" Lynn Bahta, an immunization\nexpert at the Minnesota Department of Health, told an editorial writer.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved the Pfizer and GSK vaccines in May. In\nclinical trials, the GSK vaccine was shown\n[https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/21/cdc-advisory-panel-recommends-seniors-may-get-rsv-vaccine/]\nto be 83% effective against RSV-triggered lower respiratory infections the first\nyear after receiving the shot. (Lower respiratory infections are often more\nsevere and longer-lasting than upper respiratory infections.) The Pfizer vaccine\nwas shown to be 89% effective against similar infections in the first year.\n\nAdults at highest risk for severe RSV infections include those over 65, with\nchronic heart or lung disease or weakened immune systems. While RSV typically\nmanifests in healthy individuals as a cold, it can develop into lung infections\nor pneumonia in more vulnerable groups.\n\nWhile someone seeking a vaccine would be protecting themselves, they would also\nbe protecting their community and other vulnerable people, said Eric Musungayi,\nchief health officer at People's Center, a nonprofit community health center\nserving south Minneapolis.\n\nWhile many won't have to worry about RSV (full name: respiratory syncytial\nvirus) until they reach about 65, Bahta said certain racial and ethnic groups —\nincluding African Americans, American Indians and people of Hispanic origin —\nare at a higher risk at an earlier age, which is why the CDC recommendation is\nfor adults 60 and older.\n\n\"You really begin to see the frequency of illness take off at about 65,\" Bahta\nsaid. \"But when we break down that information, we find that among certain\nracial groups and ethnic groups that incidence is much higher at a younger age.\"\n\nBahta recommended that those between the ages of 60–64 have a conversation with\ntheir doctors to determine whether they would benefit from the vaccine.\n\n\"[For] some 60-year-olds, it wouldn't be worth getting a vaccine. You want to\nget it at an age where you're at risk,\" she said. \"So, if you don't have\nmultiple health conditions, it would be better to wait.\"\n\nAnother reason to consult your doctor is the slim but present risk of\nGuillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). In clinical trials of the GSK and Pfizer\nvaccines, three participants out of about 35,000 developed GBS, a condition in\nwhich the body's immune system turns against itself about a week after receiving\nthe shot.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons why the recommendation is for this to be something\nyou discuss with your physician,\" Bahta said. \"If you're healthy and 60, the\nbenefit may not outweigh the risk. But, if you've got diabetes and asthma, RSV\ncould be deadly for you.\"\n\nBecause it's newly approved, there are still some unknowns regarding when and\nwhere older adults will be able to receive the vaccine, Bahta said. She\nencouraged interested individuals to keep tabs on their clinics' and health care\nplans' websites for updates.\n\nIf you're insured, you won't need to pay for the vaccine if you follow your\nplan's rules, Bahta said. But under- and uninsured individuals will likely not\nhave that same flexibility. However, the Minnesota Department of Health plans to\npurchase some RSV vaccines for clinics that serve under- and uninsured adults.\nThe MDH website\n[https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/basics/uuavsearch.html] has a\ntool to find free or low-cost vaccination clinics around the metro and in\ngreater Minnesota. Community health centers [https://www.mnachc.org/] like\nPeople's Center are another good resource for those worried about the potential\ncost of the vaccine.\n\nBahta implored older Americans to talk with their doctors about whether the RSV\nvaccine would benefit them.\n\n\"This is a virus that can wreak havoc in an elderly person's lungs and alter\ntheir life,\" she said. \"When you have the opportunity to get that vaccine,\nplease talk to your doctor as soon as you are able.\"\n\nFor information on locating free or low-cost vaccines, visit\nhealth.state.mn.us/people/immunize/basics/uuavsearch.html."

It was collected Saturday due to concerns regarding possible rabies\nexposure after residents noticed it hanging around the camp area for several\ndays. Those tests came back positive for rabies. \n\nThe health department recommends anyone who may have had contact with the fox\nbetween June 24 and July 8 consult their health care provider and contact the\nFCHD’s Community Health Services Office at 301-600-3342. \n\nIf any pets had contact with the fox, consult with your veterinarian and notify\nthe FCHD’s Environmental Health Office at 301-600-1717.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, rabies is a vaccine-preventable,\nzoonotic, viral disease. However, once symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100%\nfatal.\n\nThe rabies virus is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals. People\nare oftentimes infected after a deep bite or scratch. Wild animals aren't fully\nto blame when it comes to the transmission of rabies. When it comes to humans\ncontracting rabies, WHO says in up to 99% of cases the virus was transmitted to\nthe human from a domestic dog.\n\nIn America, the WHO reports that bats are now the major source of human rabies\ndeaths, however, the Mayo Clinic\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351821]\nalso lists coyotes, foxes, raccoons and skunks as animals most likely to\ntransmit the virus.\n\n“To protect your family from possible rabies exposure, do not touch or play with\nwild or stray animals and make sure that your pets are currently vaccinated,”\nsaid Barry Glotfelty, Director for the Health Department’s Environmental Health\nServices.\n\n\n\n\nRABIES SYMPTOMS\n\n\n\nThe beginning symptoms of the rabies virus are similar to flu symptoms and may\nlast for days, according to the Mayo Clinic. \n\nWHO reports there are two different forms of the disease, Furious rabies and\nParalytic rabies. \n\nSymptoms of furious rabies can include:\n\n * Hyperactivity\n * Excitable behavior\n * Hydrophobia (the fear of water)\n * Aerophobia (the fear of drafts or of fresh air)\n\nParalytic rabies accounts for about 20% of the total number of human cases. WHO\nsays this form of rabies \"runs a less dramatic and usually longer course\" than\nthe other form.\n\nSymptoms of paralytic rabies can include muscles gradually becoming paralyzed\nand a slowly developing coma. WHO says this form of rabies is often misdiagnosed\nand contributes to the under-reporting of the disease.\n\nLater signs and symptoms may include: \n\n * Fever\n * Headache\n * Nausea\n * Vomiting\n * Agitation\n * Anxiety\n * Confusion\n * Difficulty swallowing\n * Excessive salivation\n * Hallucinations\n * Insomnia\n * Partial paralysis\n\nThis comes after a fox in DC was euthanized, as were her kits, after she tested\npositive for the rabies virus.\n\n"

The idea with this device is that you\ncan know essentially in real time, or every five minutes, if there is a live\nvirus in the air.”\n\n * COVID-19 Brief newsletter: Sign up for an informed guide on the pandemic\n   [https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters]\n\nIf it does everything it’s designed to do, it could be a game-changer for\nlong-term management of COVID-19, researchers say.\n\nIt would be able to inform the public if a crowded indoor gathering was free of\nviral risk, or allow health-care professionals in a hospital setting to speedily\nidentify if viruses were threatening their patients’ safety.\n\nThe device, which researchers say is inexpensive to make, is around the size of\na football and lights up when a virus is detected, alerting those in the room\nquickly.\n\nIt was created by a team that included medical researchers and engineers at\nWashington University.\n\nThe first proof-of-concept version of the device was described in a paper\npublished Monday in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications.\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39419-z]\n\n“We are starting with SARS-CoV-2, but there are plans to also measure influenza,\nRSV, rhinovirus and other top pathogens that routinely infect people,” Cirrito\nsaid. “In a hospital setting, the monitor could be used to measure for staph or\nstrep, which cause all kinds of complications for patients. This could really\nhave a major impact on people’s health.”\n\nThe biosensor that makes up a key element of the design comes from previous work\ndone by Cirrito and Carla Yuede, an associate professor of psychiatry at the\nSchool of Medicine.\n\nThey had developed a micro-immunoelectrode (MIE) biosensor to pick up a\nbiomarker for Alzheimer’s disease, amyloid beta. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit,\nthey began to wonder if the design could be repurposed to detect SARS-CoV-2, and\nso this new project was born.\n\nResearchers had to swap out the antibody that recognizes amyloid beta for\nsomething that could recognize COVID-19 instead. A nanobody, which is a small\nantibody fragment, was developed by David Brody, a former faculty member in the\nDepartment of Neurology at the School of Medicine, at his lab at the National\nInstitutes of Health.\n\n“The nanobody-based electrochemical approach is faster at detecting the virus\nbecause it doesn’t need a reagent or a lot of processing steps,” Yuede said.\n“SARS-CoV-2 binds to the nanobodies on the surface, and we can induce oxidation\nof tyrosines on the surface of the virus using a technique called square wave\nvoltammetry to get a measurement of the amount of virus in the sample.”\n\nTyrosines are one of the amino acids that cells use to synthesize proteins.\n\nOnce the biosensor had been recalibrated to detect COVID-19, researchers\ncombined it with a specific air sampler which works by sucking air in quickly\nand mixing it with fluid on the inside of the sampler in order to trap virus\naerosols.\n\nThat fluid is then checked by the biosampler to see if there are any viral\nparticles present.\n\nThis “wet cyclone” style of air monitoring allows for researchers to search for\nthe tiniest trace of virus, researchers say.\n\n“The challenge with airborne aerosol detectors is that the level of virus in the\nindoor air is so diluted that it even pushes toward the limit of detection of\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and is like finding a needle in a haystack,”\nRajan Chakrabarty, an associate professor of energy, environmental & chemical\nengineering in McKelvey Engineering at Washington University and study author,\nsaid in the release.\n\n“The high virus recovery by the wet cyclone can be attributed to its extremely\nhigh flow rate, which allows it to sample a larger volume of air over a 5-minute\nsample collection compared with commercially available samplers.”\n\nTheir prototype has a flow rate of around 1,000 litres per minute.\n\nIn order to see if the device worked, researchers placed the device in two\napartments that belonged to people who were confirmed to have COVID-19 at the\ntime of the test.\n\nThey then compared the results of that air sampling with samples of air\ncollected from a virus-free room, in order to see if the device correctly\nidentified the presence — and absence — of COVID-19.\n\nThe devices detected COVID in the infected apartments, but did not react to air\nfrom a virus-free room.\n\nThe infected people who owned the apartments stated they weren’t experiencing\nsymptoms at the time of the sampling, and the data collected suggests that there\nwas only low viral shedding by these volunteers, according to the paper, showing\nthe sensitivity of the device.\n\nResearchers also tested the device in a chamber filled with aerosolized\nSARS-CoV-2 to see if the device could detect varying levels of virus\nconcentrations, and found it could after only a few minutes.\n\nThe emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health\nOrganization to be over in May, citing a significant decline in weekly deaths\nand hospitalizations, as well as the positive impact of vaccination campaigns.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t mean that we can forget about COVID-19 completely — the\nvirus does still exist, and can still cause serious illness or death, especially\nfor immunocompromised or otherwise high-risk populations, according to\nresearchers. What exiting the emergency phase means is that health organizations\nhave been advised to pivot to long-term management of the virus.\n\nLong-term COVID management requires monitoring for outbreaks or new variants\nthat could evade vaccine protection.\n\nA device that can monitor the air for viruses could be invaluable in a\nhealth-care setting, and could also help to make spaces more accessible to those\nwho are in high-risk categories for COVID-19 and may still be wary of crowded\ngatherings, according to the study.\n\nThe paper explained that while there was a variability in the device’s\nsensitivity depending on the strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the air due to differences\nin the spike proteins between variants, the device was still sensitive enough to\ndiscern the presence of the virus regardless of variant.\n\nWhile the prototype isn’t quite ready to be widely distributed for use, the team\nis looking to commercialize the device. To develop it further, researchers want\nto test it in multiple settings with very different aerosol compositions in\norder to see if the device can still accurately detect a live virus in the air\nwithout being confounded by any “potential interfering agents.”\n\nThere’s also one major drawback so far: the noise.\n\nAccording to the paper, the device makes a lot of sound while in use, but this\nis something that designers are working to address, possibly by using a\nlow-noise motor and “soundproofing the device exterior using an acoustic liner.”"

The CDC\n[https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/proposed-rulemaking-42-cfr-71-51.html] says that\ndog rabies was eliminated in the United States in 2007, but the virus is still\nendemic in over 100 countries.\n\n“The proposed updates aim to protect the public’s health by preventing the\nreintroduction of dog rabies into the United States,” CDC spokesperson David\nDaigle said. “These updates would establish an importation system designed to\nreduce fraud and improve the U.S. government’s ability to verify that imported\ndogs have met U.S. entry requirements.”\n\nAlthough rabies among humans is rare in the United States, the virus kills about\n59,000 people around the world each year, most of them children bitten by dogs,\naccording to the CDC. Exposure to infected dogs causes 99% of human rabies\ndeaths worldwide.\n\nAfter entering [https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/transmission/body.html] the body –\nusually via the bite of an infected animal – the virus travels through the\nnerves to the brain, where it multiplies and causes inflammation. By the time it\nreaches the brain and symptoms appear, the disease is usually fatal.\n\nThe CDC’s proposed regulation creates additional safeguards to prevent rabies\nfrom arriving from overseas. For instance, dogs from rabies-free or “low-risk”\ncountries would be allowed to enter with written documentation that the dog has\nlived in the low-risk setting for the past six months.\n\nFor dogs who were vaccinated in the US and are returning from countries with\nhigh rabies incidence, their owners would be required to bring them to an\nairport with a CDC quarantine station. They would also need to have a rabies\nvaccination form completed and signed by a veterinarian approved by the US\nDepartment of Agriculture.\n\nThe proposed updates place the most restrictions on people seeking to import\ndogs from high-risk countries who have also been vaccinated abroad.\n\nIn those situations, owners would need to have a valid rabies vaccination form\ncompleted by a licensed veterinarian and signed by an official government\nveterinarian of the exporting country. Once in the US, the dogs would have to be\nexamined and revaccinated at a CDC-registered animal care facility.\n\nThe CDC has opened the guidelines to public comment online\n[http://www.regulations.gov/] until September 8.\n\nAlthough the policy that the CDC hopes to update includes rules for dog and cat\nimportation, cats are not required to have proof of rabies vaccination, and the\nCDC’s changes don’t affect cat imports.\n\nRabies can be a particularly expensive virus to treat. According to the\nguidelines\n[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/10/2023-14343/control-of-communicable-diseases-foreign-quarantine-importation-of-dogs-and-cats#h-9],\nthe importation of an infected dog in 2019 cost state governments over $400,000\nto investigate and administer post-exposure prophylaxis treatment.\n\nThe updates come on the heels of the CDC’s decision to extend its temporary\nsuspension of dog imports from over 100 countries with a high rabies risk until\nJuly 31, 2024. The suspension\n[https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/14/health/dogs-cdc-rabies-import/index.html#:~:text=The%20US%20Centers%20for%20Disease,in%20pets%2C%20the%20CDC%20said.]\nbegan in 2021 after cases of imported dog rabies and a 52%\n[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/01/27/2023-01688/notice-of-extension-of-temporary-suspension-of-dogs-entering-the-united-states-from-countries-with-a#h-8]\nuptick in falsified rabies vaccination certificates.\n\nStretched thin due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the agency opted to suspend the\narrival of dogs who had traveled to one of 113\n[https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/high-risk.html]\ncountries considered at high risk for dog rabies, including Brazil, China and\nIndia.\n\nIn addition to the more stringent vaccination verification and screening\nefforts, the proposed updates require that all dogs entering the US be\nmicrochipped, at least 6 months old and healthy upon arrival.\n\nHowever, the proposed restrictions face challenges.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the animal rights advocacy group Animal Wellness Action\ndecried the agency’s proposal as “draconian,” saying the guidelines “will put\nAmericans overseas at risk of losing their animals” and could “terribly\ncomplicate” US charities working with dogs abroad.\n\nIn 2021, a letter signed by 57 US representatives also called on the CDC to lift\nits suspension of canine imports from high-risk countries, describing the policy\nas a “one-size-fits-all approach” that “prevents thousands of dogs from … being\nrescued and adopted.”\n\nBut the CDC insists that its proposal is critical to preventing the re-emergence\nof rabies.\n\n“We understand the important role pets play in our lives and that there are many\nhealth benefits to owning a pet,” Daigle said. “However, the close relationships\nbetween dogs and people means there is a direct public health risk to people who\ninteract with inadequately vaccinated dogs imported from countries with high\nrisk for dog rabies.”"

Though low-fat diets have\nlong been touted as the healthiest option, the PURE study emphasizes focusing on\nprotective foods, like nuts and fish and two servings of whole-fat dairy per\nday. While whole-fat dairy is still a bit controversial, growing research\n[https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15803/is-saturated-fat-truly-bad-for-your-heart/]\nshows that saturated fat, particularly from dairy sources, isn't linked to an\nincreased risk of heart disease. Plus, dairy\n[https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031955/is-dairy-good-for-you/],\nparticularly fermented unsweetened dairy like yogurt and kefir, is a\ngut-healthy, high-protein food group that can be included in a healthy eating\npattern if you don't have lactose intolerance.\n\nThere are many ways to include more dairy in your diet, from drinking more milk\nto eating yogurt or cereal in the morning. Whole-milk yogurt topped with fruit\nand granola\n[https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/20461/mealtimes/breakfast-brunch/cereals/granola-muesli/]\nor nuts makes a great and filling breakfast, or try our Strawberry-Chocolate\nGreek Yogurt Bark\n[https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259080/strawberry-chocolate-greek-yogurt-bark/]\nfor a nutritious dessert or snack option.\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nAll in all, supporting a balanced eating pattern is the most effective way to\nlower your risk of heart disease and mortality, according to the European Heart\nJournal study. If you're looking to follow a heart-healthy eating pattern and\nare unsure of where to start, the Mediterranean diet\n[https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290484/why-the-mediterranean-diet-is-so-healthy/]\nand the DASH diet\n[https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8017462/dash-diet-heart-disease-new-study-recipes/]\nare both easy and healthy diets that include the six recommended foods in your\nmeals without excessive restrictions.\n\nUp next: Fad Diets: The Most Popular Ones and Are They Healthy?\n[https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041459/fad-diets/]"

So the combination of increases in incidence and decreases in\ndeaths means that there are more and more cancer survivors that need long-term\ncare and resources.”\n\nThe researchers gave a detailed look at incidence rates by cancer type, age\ngroup, geographic region and other demographic breakdowns. Siegel says that this\ndetailed data could be helpful to direct resources where they are needed most,\nparticularly in terms of clinical trials for treatments and supportive care, and\nimprove the lives of these patients.\n\nLeukemia was the most commonly diagnosed childhood cancer, with new diagnoses\nincreasing from 43 cases for every 1 million children in 2003 to 47 in 2019,\naccording to CDC data [https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/#/ChildhoodCancerICCC/].\nNew diagnoses of lymphoma, liver tumors, bone tumors and thyroid carcinomas also\nincreased.\n\nHowever, melanoma diagnoses decreased, dropping from about 6 new cases per 1\nmillion children in 2003 to about 3 in 2019.\n\nFor this study, the researchers used data from medical records that was compiled\nin the CDC’s federal cancer statistics database. All 50 states were reporting\ndata by 2003, offering a complete picture of pediatric cancer in the US\npopulation. It takes a few years after a diagnosis for data to become available\nin the system, making 2019 the most recent year with data available at the time\nof the study.\n\nThis data lag could explain part of the recent dip in incidence rates,\nespecially amid logistical challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, Siegel\nsaid. But there is room for hope.\n\n“It is very possible that there are some positive reasons why cancer [incidence]\nis decreasing,” he said. In the study, Siegel and his fellow authors point to a\npotential relationship between the lower rates of melanoma and public health\ninterventions emphasizing the importance of sun protection during younger years.\n\n“But we do have to interpret with caution, because there are some data artifacts\nthat could come into play,” Siegel said.\n\nFactors such as changes to cancer detection, reporting and risk factors also add\nto the complexity of the trends.\n\nBecause pediatric cancer is rare, a lot of data is needed to understand it,\nSiegel said. The Childhood Cancer STAR Act\n[https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/legislative/recent-public-laws/star-act] –\nfocused on survivorship, treatment, access and research – was reauthorized this\nyear with commitments through fiscal year 2028.\n\nOne goal of that legislation is to make pediatric cancer data accessible in a\nshorter timeframe.\n\n“We’re hoping that the data will become more real-time and then more rapidly\nhelp clinicians use it to meet patient needs and improve outcomes,” Siegel said."

Derek Davis/Staff Photographer\n\nThe Maine Department of Health and Human Services is proposing that the COVID-19\nvaccine be removed from the list of required immunizations for health care\nworkers.\n\nThe department says the vaccination remains an important tool to protect public\nhealth, but that the requirement for health care workers achieved the intended\nbenefit of savings lives, protecting health care capacity and limiting the\nspread of the virus during the height of the pandemic.\n\nMaine is one of four remaining states with some type of COVID-19 vaccine\nrequirement in place.\n\n“Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Maine has followed the science in\ndeveloping policies to limit the spread of the virus,” DHHS Commissioner Jeanne\nLambrew said in a statement Tuesday. “Today, a robust body of evolving evidence\ntells us that this requirement achieved its goals of saving lives and protecting\nhealth at a crucial time. We continue to encourage all Maine people, including\ndedicated health care workers tending to Maine’s most vulnerable residents, to\nstay up to date on COVID-19 vaccination.”\n\nThe decision was welcomed by hospitals and other health care providers hit by\nworker shortages during the pandemic.\n\n“This (vaccine) requirement protected our patients, caregivers, and hospital\nduring the height of the pandemic,” said Steven Michaud, president of the Maine\nHospital Association. “We support this science-based update to the rule and will\ncontinue to be guided by patient safety in our efforts to limit the spread of\nthe virus and promote vaccination as a valuable tool to protect public health.”\n\nThe vaccination requirement for health care workers went into effect on Oct. 20,\n2021. Health care workers upset by the requirement sued the state, arguing that\nit was their religious right to refuse the vaccine\n[https://www.pressherald.com/2022/07/12/health-care-workers-who-sued-state-over-vaccine-mandate-reveal-names-in-court/]\nbecause of their belief that fetal stem cells from abortions are used to develop\nthe vaccines.\n\nThe proposed rule change, filed Tuesday with the Department of the Secretary of\nState, is based on available clinical and epidemiological data about COVID-19,\nincreased population immunity resulting from vaccination and prior infections,\ndecreasing disease severity, improved treatments and declining infection and\ndeath rates, DHHS said.\n\nIt expects the rule will be published next Wednesday and be adopted by the end\nof the year following public comment. The department said it will exercise\nenforcement discretion regarding COVID-19 vaccination of health care workers\nduring the rulemaking process.\n\nEMS WORKERS SEPARATE\n\nIt remains uncertain, however, whether the proposal will be embraced by licensed\nemergency medical services personnel such as emergency medical technicians and\nparamedics.\n\nMaine’s Board of Emergency Medical Services, a diverse group of doctors, nurses\nand paramedics, will consider adoption of the DHHS rule at its Aug. 2 meeting,\nsaid J. Sam Hurley, director of Maine’s Emergency Medical Services. He said the\nBoard of Emergency Medical Services is an authority treated separately from\nhealth care employees, who typically work in hospitals or nursing homes.\n\nHurley said the board could follow DHHS’ recommendation, retain the current\npolicy of requiring emergency medical service responders to be vaccinated, or\nrevise its existing guidelines.\n\nThere are more than 1,700 licensed EMS workers in Maine, a number that has\nremained stable since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hurley said.\n\n“Throughout the pandemic, it has been imperative that our health care system\nevolve with our response to the pandemic,” Hurley said in a telephone interview\nTuesday night. “As the science changes, we too must evolve with the science.”\n\nThough there were some emergency medical services staffing shortages near the\nbeginning of the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 vaccination requirement –\nmostly in smaller municipal departments in rural areas of the state – those\nnumbers have since stabilized, Hurley said.\n\n“The system as a whole did not experience a dramatic impact after the pandemic\nand we should mention that the immunization requirement was proven to have saved\nlives,” he said.\n\nMaine requires the immunization of employees of health care facility to reduce\nthe risk of exposure to and transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases. The\nstate defines health care workers as those employed by a hospital, multilevel\nhealth care facility, home health agency, nursing facility, residential care\nfacility and intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual\ndisabilities.\n\nLAWSUIT TO PROCEED\n\nThe law firm representing the workers who sued the state said that it plans to\nforge ahead with the lawsuit.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday night, Horatio Mihet, chief litigation counsel for\nLiberty Counsel, a law firm based in Orlando, Florida, said the firm continues\nto represent seven Maine health care workers who lost their jobs because their\nreligious exemptions from Maine’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate were denied.\n\nThe suit argues that the plaintiffs have a religious right to refuse the vaccine\nover their belief that fetal stem cells from abortions were used to develop it.\nPlaintiffs also argued that the state mandate was discriminatory by allowing for\nmedical exemptions, but not religious ones.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling on May 25, a panel of three judges\n[https://www.pressherald.com/2023/05/25/court-grants-new-life-to-lawsuit-challenging-maines-vaccine-mandate-for-healthcare-workers/]\nfor the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found U.S. District Judge Jon Levy had\nnot properly weighed the possible public health impact of religious exemptions,\nwhich are not allowed by the state’s vaccination policy, and ordered the lower\ncourt to review that portion of the case.\n\n“We intend to proceed with the lawsuit,” Mihet said, adding that Liberty Counsel\nalso will seek a judicial decree in U.S. District Court in Maine that seeks to\nprohibit Mills from permanently enacting a vaccine mandate again.\n\nMihet said the state’s proposal to remove the vaccine mandate comes on the eve\nof a status conference Wednesday with the presiding judge to determine if and\nwhen the case should go to trial. Mihet said the DHHS proposal is a step in the\nright direction, but he is not convinced that Maine has seen the end of\ngovernment-imposed vaccine mandates for health care workers.\n\n“I have no joy in what the governor has done and we intend to hold her\naccountable,” Mihet said.\n\nRepublicans in the Legislature responded to the proposed rule change, saying\nthat they had argued early on that the mandate would worsen the shortage of\nhealth care and EMS workers.\n\n“We appreciate that Maine DHHS has recognized the mandate does not serve any\npublic health interest and begun the rulemaking process to repeal it,” the\nstatement said. “We urge the administration to expedite the process well before\nthe stated end of 2023. Republicans hope that some of our health care and EMS\nheroes who left the profession – and in some cases even the state – can return\nto serve Maine once again.”\n\nThe Maine Health Care Association and Maine Medical Association joined the Maine\nHospital Association in supporting the decision to end the vaccine requirement.\n\n“The requirement achieved its intended goals and we fully support this change.\nInfections remain low and Maine has some of the highest vaccination rates for\nlong-term care staff and residents. As the science evolves, we will continue to\nfollow best practices for infection prevention and control and will promote\nongoing efforts to educate our community about the many benefits of vaccines,”\nAngela Westhoff, president and CEO of the Maine Health Care Association, said in\na statement.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend\neveryone ages 6 months and older – including health care workers – remain up to\ndate on the vaccination. Health care providers remain free to implement COVID-19\nvaccination requirements for their employees, DHHS said.\n\nMaine has been rated among the top states on vaccination and was among the\nlowest for COVID-19 deaths. Maine currently ranks third overall on bivalent\nbooster vaccination and first for people 65 and older, according to DHHS.\n\n\nRELATED HEADLINES\n\n * Federal judge dismisses health care workers’ suit against COVID-19 vaccine\n   mandate\n   [https://www.pressherald.com/2022/08/19/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-workers-suit-against-covid-19-vaccine-mandate/]\n * Health care workers appeal dismissal of lawsuit over Maine’s vaccine mandate\n   [https://www.pressherald.com/2022/09/16/health-care-workers-suing-vaccine-mandate-appeal-after-federal-judges-dismissal/]\n * Court grants new life to lawsuit challenging Maine’s vaccine mandate for\n   health care workers\n   [https://www.pressherald.com/2023/05/25/court-grants-new-life-to-lawsuit-challenging-maines-vaccine-mandate-for-healthcare-workers/]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nUse the form below to reset your password.

        "content": "Maryna Terletska/Getty Images\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new oral solution for\ncolonoscopy [https://www.health.com/colonoscopy-7254954] preparation that\nexperts say could spur more people to undergo potentially life-saving\nscreenings.\n\nThe solution, Suflave, is manufactured by Sebela Pharmaceuticals and is a\n“low-volume, safe and effective colonoscopy preparation” for adults that tastes\nsimilar to a lemon-lime sports drink, the company said in a press release on\nJune 22 announcing the FDA approval. \n\nThe company hopes that Suflave’s taste will make it stand out among existing\nsolutions. Colonoscopy preparation drinks, which are used to cleanse the colon\nbefore the procedure, are generally known for their unappealing taste. While\nhaving to drink an unpleasant-tasting solution may seem like a relatively minor\nconcern, it can play a crucial role in a person’s willingness to get a\ncolonoscopy.\n\n“Recent literature indicates that, from patients’ perspective, the colon prep is\nthe worst part and greatest deterrent to colonoscopy,” Douglas K. Rex, MD\n[https://iuhealth.org/find-providers/provider/douglas-k-rex-md-8942], a\ndistinguished professor emeritus at Indiana University School of Medicine and a\nfull-time clinical gastroenterologist\n[https://www.health.com/gastroenterologist-7253694] at Indiana University\nHospital, told Health.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends people at average\nrisk for colorectal cancer get screened at age 45 and then at regular intervals,\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that only 72% of\nadults in the United States are up to date with their screenings.\n\nA colonoscopy isn’t the only option for screening for colorectal cancer—there\nare others, such as at-home stool kits—but it’s largely considered one of the\nmost effective due to its high sensitivity.\n\nIn its press release, Sebela Pharmaceuticals said it tested Suflave against\nanother solution, the Suprep Bowel Prep Kit, in a “head-to-head pivotal study.”\nIt found that 94% of participants involved in the study “achieved successful\nbowel cleansing” with Suflave. Nearly 80% of participants reported that it\ntasted “neutral to very pleasant compared to Suprep.” In addition, the majority\nof participants said it “tastes like a sports drink,” 87% found it\ntolerable-to-very easy to consume, and 80% reported they would ask for this\nsolution for a future colonoscopy.\n\nLess than 8% of participants said they had adverse gastrointestinal events after\ndrinking Suflave.\n\n“What is remarkable about Suflave is that it has a taste similar to a lemon-lime\nsports drink yet retains high levels of efficacy among available prep options,”\nsaid Dr Rex, who was involved with the development of Suflave. “Positive patient\nexperience ratings for Suflave may help reduce colonoscopy hesitancy and allow\npatients to feel less anxious about their colonoscopy procedure.”\n\nPatients have more than a dozen options for colonoscopy preparation solutions,\nmost of which have FDA approval, Rishika Chugh, MD\n[https://medicine.ucsf.edu/people/rishika-chugh], an assistant professor of\nmedicine in the division of gastroenterology at the University of California San\nFrancisco (UCSF), told Health. She did not participate in the development of\nSuflave.\n\nDr. Chugh said while the products vary in taste and volume, requiring people to\nconsume anywhere from two to four liters, they are all polyethylene glycol\n(PEG)-based. “Polyethylene glycol is an osmotic laxative, pulling water into the\ncolon to allow for increased bowel movements,” she said.\n\nSuflave is also PEG-based, according to Dr. Chugh, but stands out because it\n“reportedly has a lemon-lime flavor that is expected to be more palatable than\nexisting preparations. In addition to that, it does seem to be lower volume than\nmany of the existing preparations.”\n\nThat’s important, Dr. Rex explained, because low volume colonoscopy preparation\nsolutions—as well as those that split the drink into multiple doses—have been\nshown to “be key factors in improving patients’ ability to complete the\ncolonoscopy prep and achieve a prep adequate for a successful colonoscopy.”\n\n“For instance, many preparations require the consumption of 4 liters of\npreparation solution, whereas a low volume preparation like Suflave requires a\nsplit dose of only 2 liters of preparation solution—1 liter of preparation\nsolution per dose,” he said.\n\n\nBoth Dr. Rex and Dr. Chugh said there is a need for new and improved colonoscopy\nprep solutions.\n\n“Many patients do struggle with drinking the full preparation for a colonoscopy\nwith major issues being taste and large volume,” said Dr. Chugh. “We have tricks\nto make preparations more palatable— mix with another clear liquid such as\nGatorade, put it on ice, drink through a straw. We also prescribe anti-nausea\nmedication. However, these interventions don’t always work.”\n\n“Suflave may help to fill this gap,” she added.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rex, Suflave may even curb the use of over-the-counter laxative\ncombinations that aren’t FDA-approved and may pose risks. People commonly take\n“a stimulant laxative associated with abdominal cramping, and a second laxative\nmixed with a sports drink,” Dr. Rex said. “Despite reports of suboptimal\nefficacy, [this combination] is likely used because of its taste... This\nreinforces that an unmet need exists among patients for better bowel preparation\noptions.”\n\nDr. Rex emphasized that Suflave may save lives. More than 50,000 people die each\nyear from colorectal cancers—the third most common type of cancer in the\nU.S.—and 90% of those deaths may be preventable through screenings.\n\n“Screening rates are still relatively low in younger patients and certain\ndemographics, particularly Hispanics,” he said. “Better colonoscopy prep options\nwill help improve detection rates for CRC (colorectal cancers) and reduce\npatient hesitancy due to the fears associated with tolerability and palatability\nof the colon prep,” he said.\n\nSuflave is expected to launch in early August 2023 and will require a\nprescription from a licensed physician in the U.S., according to Dr. Rex.\n"

        "content": "The New Mexico Department of Health is urging former customers of the\nnow-defunct VIP Beauty Salon and Spa in Albuquerque to get tested for HIV and\nother bloodborne infections. Health officials have identified several new cases\nof HIV this year tied to services provided by the spa, including so-called\n“vampire facials.” The spa was shut down in 2018 over unsafe practices that\nexposed customers to these infections.\n\nShould Facial Recognition Technology be Banned? | Future Tech\n\n * Off\n * English\n\nVampire facials [https://www.popsci.com/vampire-facials-HIV/] are a type of\nmicroneedling procedure, which puncture the skin with tiny needles in an attempt\nto stimulate healing and collagen production in the surrounding area. In a\nvampire facial, platelet-rich blood is then added to the skin to ostensibly\nboost this healing ability, causing a dramatic blood-soaked appearance.\n\nThere’s only limited evidence\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6243404/] suggesting that\nplatelet-rich blood can provide any extra skincare benefits. But the procedure\nitself should be normally low risk, since the blood is supposed to be sourced\nfrom the same person undergoing the facial. However, if the tools used for a\nvampire facial aren’t sterilized properly between customers, there is the\npossibility of cross-contamination. And that appears to be exactly what happened\nat the VIP Beauty Salon and Spa.\n\nAbout five years ago, the New Mexico Department of Health and the New Mexico\nRegulation and Licensing Department, Barbers and Cosmetologists Board conducted\nan investigation into the spa, identifying practices there that could have\nspread bloodborne infections like HIV. The spa permanently closed in September\n2018 as a result. More than 100 former customers were tested for these\ninfections over the next two years, with two cases of HIV potentially tied to\nthe spa discovered in 2019. And in June 2022, according to the health\ndepartment, the owner of the spa pleaded guilty to five felony counts of\npracticing medicine without a license.\n\nUnfortunately, the Department of Health’s Infectious Disease Bureau received a\nreport this year of a newly identified HIV case—one with no self-reported risk\nfactors other than having gotten a vampire facial at the spa in 2018. The case\nled the department to reopen their investigation and they have since discovered\nseveral other HIV cases directly or indirectly linked to the spa.\n\nHealth officials are advising everyone who ever received an injection-related\nservice at the VIP Spa, including vampire facials, to seek out HIV, hepatitis B,\nand hepatitis C lab testing. Importantly, even those who originally tested\nnegative during the initial investigation are being asked to get retested.\n\n“It’s very important that we spread the word and remind people who received any\nkind of injection-related to services provided at the VIP Spa to come in for\nfree and confidential testing,” said Laura Parajon, deputy secretary for the New\nMexico Department of Health, in a statement\n[https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2023/7/?view=1988].\n\nThe New Mexico Department of Health has arranged three walk-in testing events\nfor former customers this month at the South Valley Public Health office in\nAlbuquerque, two of which are still available. People should also be able to\nschedule free and confidential testing at any other public health office in New\nMexico. And information about other testing services located in the state can be\nfound here. [https://nmhivguide.org/]"

That hunt, which is ongoing, has implicated genes involved in the\nimmune system [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01655-0] and in\nallowing the virus SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells2\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02269-2#ref-CR2].\n\nThe long-COVID study is a spin-off from that effort, says Hugo Zeberg, a\ngeneticist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and a lead author of the\npreprint. To study the condition, the team compiled data from 24 studies\ninvolving a total of nearly 6,500 people diagnosed with long COVID, as well as\nmore than one million other participants who served as controls.\n\n[https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-023-02269-2/d41586-023-02269-2_23195404.jpg]\n\nHow common is long COVID? Why studies give different answers\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01702-2]\n\nIn one analysis that combined data from 11 of those studies, researchers found a\nparticular region of the genome that was associated with about 1.6-fold higher\nodds of developing long COVID. That segment of DNA is near a gene called FOXP4,\nwhich is active in the lungs and other organs. The variant linked to long COVID\nis also associated with higher expression of FOXP4 in lung cells.\n\nPrevious research has linked the same gene to an increased risk of severe\nCOVID-19, and Zeberg and his colleagues found that it is also associated with\nlung cancer. Although having severe COVID-19 increases the risk of developing\nlong COVID, the team found that the contribution of the DNA variant to\nlong-COVID risk was too large to be explained by its link to severe COVID-19\nalone. “This variant has a much stronger impact on long COVID than its impact on\nseverity,” says Zeberg.\n\nReplicating that finding in other data sets would help to strengthen the study’s\nconclusions, says Zhongshan Cheng, a bioinformatician at St. Jude Children’s\nResearch Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Many of the data used in the long-COVID\nanalysis were also used in the analysis that found a link between FOX4P and\nsevere COVID-19, he notes. Fresh data would help to rule out the possibility\nthat other factors, such as lung cancer, could have influenced the apparent\nassociation with FOX4P.\n\n\nMORE TO COME\n\nEven so, the study is a breakthrough, Cheng says, and future studies will\nprobably add to the list of known genetic risk factors for long COVID.\n\n“It won’t just be a single answer, there will be a whole variety of people’s\nvulnerabilities contributing to why they haven’t recovered from COVID,” says\nPonting. He and his colleagues proposed a study that would have included DNA\nfrom 15,000 people with long COVID. But grant reviewers rejected the proposal,\nhe says, because they thought the condition too complex to be dissected in the\nway Ponting’s team suggested.\n\n“I disagree,” he says. “It is very complicated, but also very important to pick\napart. The health and socio-economic costs of long COVID are enormous.”"

The industry has maintained that it is\nambiguous how laws written during the analog era apply to an asset class born on\nthe internet.\n\nThe court published the conclusions in an order partially granting a motion for\nsummary judgment in the seminal U.S. SEC case against the blockchain platform.\nThe regulator in 2020 filed suit against the firm and its executives CEO Brad\nGarlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen alleging failure to register XRP as\nsecurity before offering around $1.3 billion worth of tokens.\n\n\nTHE RULING\n\n\n\nAccording to the order from the U.S. Court for the Southern District of New\nYork, Ripple first sold around $728.9 million worth of XRP directly to\ninstitutional buyers, hedge funds and other parties. These \"institutional sales\"\nconstituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation\nof federal securities law, the order said, as it found investors would have\npurchased XRP with the expectation that they would profit from Ripple's work.\n\nRipple used the funds it received from institutional sales to \"promote and\nincrease the value of XRP by developing uses for XRP and protecting the XRP\ntrading market,\" the order said.\n\nThe SEC’s motion for summary judgment was granted by the court as it applies to\nthe institutional sale, and otherwise denied.\n\nThe \"programmatic sales\" of XRP through exchanges and algorithms did not qualify\nas the sale of securities because the SEC cannot definitively say speculative\ninvestors had “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the\nentrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”\n\n\"There is no evidence that a reasonable Programmatic Buyer, who was generally\nless sophisticated as an investor, shared similar “understandings and\nexpectations” and could parse through the multiple documents and statements that\nthe SEC highlights, which include statements (sometimes inconsistent) across\nmany social media platforms and news sites from a variety of Ripple speakers\n(with different levels of authority) over an extended eight-year period,\" the\norder said.\n\nLarsen and Garlinghouse's own sale of XRP falls into this category, the order\nsaid, along with other distributions. Ripple's motion for summary judgment in\nlieu of \"programmatic sales,\" other distributions, and Larsen’s and\nGarlinghouse’s sales, was granted.\n\nAnother motion by the SEC for summary judgment on an \"aiding and abetting claim\"\nagainst the two executives was denied as the court deemed it \"is not clear\nwhether Larsen and Garlinghouse knew or recklessly disregarded that securities\nlaws, rather than laws under other regulatory regimes, applied to XRP.\"\n\n\"We said in Dec. 2020 that we were on the right side of the law, and will be on\nthe right side of history.

Similar campaigns have\ntargeted Bud Light, Target\n[https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/08/business/target-attorneys-general-pride-month/index.html]\nand other major brands for partnering with LGBTQ+ influencers or selling certain\nPride-themed merchandise.\n\n“The last thing that I want for the company is for the company to be drawn into\nany culture wars,” Iger said. “Our goal is to tell wonderful stories and a\npositive impact on the world.”\n\nIger said his company will be “expansive” in its thinking about the future of\nits linear TV networks, acknowledging that a sale remains an option.\n\nIger said that Disney has to be “open minded and objective about the future of\nthe business,” adding that networks like these “may not be core to Disney.”\nDisney owns several linear TV channels, including ABC, FX, National Geographic\nand Freeform.\n\nProgramming produced by those networks might be core to Disney, but the\ndistribution model is “definitely broken,” Iger said.\n\n“The disruptive forces that have been preying on that business are greater than\nI thought,” Iger said. “We have to come to grips with that.”\n\nLinear business is in a decline as more people cut the cord\n[https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/business/streaming-cable-viewership/index.html]\nand watching programming on streaming platforms.\n\nDisney (DIS)\n[https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DIS&source=story_quote_link] also\nowns ESPN, but Iger said that he’s “bullish” on sports and wants to stay in the\nsports business.

The run of softer inflation readings likely will push the\nFederal Reserve closer to ending its fastest monetary policy tightening campaign\nsince the 1980s.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates later this month after\nholding them steady in June.\n\n\"The Fed's expected hike at the end of the month will probably be the last of\nthe cycle,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Dallas. \"Things\ncould still go wrong if another shock exerts new upward pressure on prices, but\nwith the economy slowing and a modest margin of slack opening in its productive\ncapacity, that seems less of a risk now.\"\n\nThe producer price index for final demand nudged up 0.1% last month. Data for\nMay was revised to show the PPI falling 0.4% instead of the previously reported\n0.3%.\n\nIn the 12 months through June, the PPI climbed 0.1%. That was the smallest\nyear-on-year gain since August 2020 and followed a 0.9% increase in May.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would rise 0.2% on the month\nand advance 0.4% on a year-on-year basis.\n\nInflation is easing as supply chain bottlenecks disappear and demand for goods\nslows in response to higher interest rates. Last year's surge in prices is also\ndropping out of the calculation of annual inflation rates.\n\nThe Fed has raised its policy rate by 500 basis points since March 2022.\nFinancial markets have priced in a 25-basis-point rate increase at the central\nbank's July 25-26 policy meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool.\n\nA 0.2% increase in the prices of services accounted for the rise in the monthly\nPPI last month. Services had increased 0.2% in May. They were boosted by a 5.4%\nsurge in deposit services, including checking and savings accounts.\n\nThere were also increases in the cost of food and alcohol retailing. Wholesale\nhotel and motel accommodation prices rose 2.3%, while the cost of hospital\ninpatient care increased 0.6% and airline tickets rebounded 1.1%. But portfolio\nmanagement fees dropped 0.3%, declining for a second straight month.\n\nThese services components feed into the calculation of the Personal Consumption\nExpenditures (PCE) price indexes, the inflation measures tracked by the Fed for\nits 2% target.\n\nThe cost of transporting freight by road fell 2.1% and plunged 13.7%\nyear-on-year, the most since 2010.\n\nGoods prices were unchanged after dropping 1.6% in May. Energy prices rebounded\n0.7% while the cost of food fell for a third consecutive month. Goods prices\ndropped 4.4% on a year-on-year basis, the largest decline since April 2020.\n\nFactory goods deflation and declining freight costs suggested that the economy\nwas slowing, potentially removing the need for the Fed to raise rates beyond\nthis month.\n\n\"This is another positive report for investors desperate to see inflation\ndissipate,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial in Charlotte,\nNorth Carolina.\n\nStocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of\ncurrencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.\n\n\nCORE INFLATION SLOWING\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core goods\nprices fell 0.2% last month after climbing 0.1% in May.\n\nThe narrower measure of core PPI, which strips out food, energy and trade\nservices components, edged up 0.1% after being unchanged in May. In the 12\nmonths through June, the core PPI advanced 2.6%. That was the smallest\nyear-on-year gain since February 2021 and followed a 2.8% increase in May.\n\nWith the CPI and PPI data in hand, economists estimated that the core PCE price\nindex rose 0.2% in June. That would be the smallest gain since last November and\nwould follow a 0.3% increase in May. The core PCE price index was forecast\nadvancing 4.2% year-on-year in June, which would be the smallest rise since\nSeptember 2021, after increasing 4.6% in May.\n\nWhile inflation is slowing, the labor market remains tight. A separate report\nfrom the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits\ndropped 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 237,000 for the week ended July 8.\nEconomists had forecast 250,000 claims for the latest week.\n\nThe data included the July 4 Independence Day holiday, which could have caused\nsome distortions. Automakers also normally idle plants in July to retool for new\nmodels. But those temporary plant closures do not always happen around the same\ntime, which could throw off the model that the government uses to strip out\nseasonal fluctuations.\n\nClaims, relative to the size of the labor market, are well below the 280,000\nlevel that economists say would signal a significant slowdown in job growth.\n\nThe Fed's \"Beige Book\"\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-economic-activity-rose-slightly-recent-weeks-fed-survey-shows-2023-07-12/]\nreport on Wednesday described demand for labor as having \"remained healthy\" in\nJune, with pockets of worker shortages in health care, transportation and\nhospitality as well as high-skilled positions.\n\nBut it also noted that \"some contacts reported that hiring was getting more\ntargeted and selective.\"\n\nThe number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy\nfor hiring, increased 11,000 to a still-low 1.729 million during the week ending\nJuly 1, the claims report showed. The historically low so-called claims suggests\nsome laid-off workers are quickly finding new employment.\n\nBut some economists warned the labor market could slow significantly by year\nend, arguing that factory goods deflation combined with the punitive borrowing\ncosts pointed to a recession.\n\n\"Deflation in core producer prices means demand is weak so production cuts and\nthe loss of new orders may eventually engender belt-tightening and layoffs later\non in the second half of the year,\" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at\nFWDBONDS in New York.\n\nReporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Paul Simao\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n[https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html]"

        "content": "During a combative hearing on Tuesday, House Republicans alleged that Federal\nTrade Commission Chair Lina Khan was “harassing” Twitter, describing the\nagency’s months-long probe of Elon Musk’s company as a “shakedown.”\n\nThey based their accusations, in part, on a new legal complaint from Twitter\nasking a federal court to terminate an FTC order restricting the company’s data\nsecurity practices, alleging that the agency has “spiraled out of control and\nbecome tainted by bias.”\n\nHouse Republicans seized on allegations in the complaint that the FTC attempted\nto influence Ernst & Young, an independent auditor Twitter hired to assess its\ncompliance with the order.\n\nYet the complaint — and Republican committee members — omitted key details from\nthat deposition, which paints a stark picture of the chaos and upheaval at\nTwitter during Musk’s takeover.\n\nDavid Roque, an Ernst & Young partner, told lawyers during a deposition last\nmonth that Ernst & Young contacted Twitter weekly, repeatedly asking the company\nto pay outstanding invoices totaling $500,000. He said the firm parted ways with\nthe company amid “constant turnover” on Twitter’s executive team.\n\n“There would have been a large burden on a smaller number of people to execute\nthe same control structure,” he told an FTC investigator, who asked how the\n“resource constraints” would affect Twitter’s data security program. He said the\nturnover could result in more security mistakes or errors, because remaining\nstaff might be tired or performing tasks that are not familiar.\n\nHe also said Ernst & Young was concerned that it would be unable to complete the\nfieldwork necessary for its assessments, after Twitter repeatedly told the\nassessor it was not prepared for it to come on-site.\n\nThe filings come amid a dramatic standoff between Twitter’s parent company and\nthe FTC, which has warned the company in recent days that its failures to\nrespond to document requests put it out of step with a consent order, which the\nFTC updated last year following allegations\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/25/twitter-fine-ftc/?itid=lk_inline_manual_14]the\ncompany deceptively used phone numbers and emails to target ads. The agency has\nalso said it will consider Twitter in violation of its order if Musk does not\nappear for a deposition July 25 in San Francisco. In its complaint, Twitter\nsought a stay of that appearance.\n\nTwitter’s parent company filed the complaint in the U.S. District Court of\nNorthern California just hours before Khan’s testimony began on Capitol Hill.\nKhan received a hostile reception from Republicans who have accused her of\nmismanaging the agency and conducting a politicized probe into Twitter. Her\nleadership of the FTC has emerged as a political lightning rod at the center of\na partisan debate over the future of social media, which has intensified over\nthe last year as Musk took over Twitter and gutted many of the content\nmoderation teams and systems that the company’s prior leadership had in place.\n\nMusk followed along with the hearing on Twitter, tweeting that the exchanges\nbetween Khan and House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) were\n“extremely concerning.”\n\n“Insanely illegal overreach by the FTC,” Musk tweeted\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1679507880012296192?s=20], responding to a\ntweet from House Republicans sharing excerpts from Twitter’s case.\n\nJordan called Khan’s leadership a “disaster” in his opening remarks,\ncharacterizing her approach as “intimidation followed by inaction.”\n\nDuring a tense exchange, Jordan pressed Khan on the FTC’s Twitter investigation,\nasking why she’s “harassing Twitter.” Khan responded that the FTC’s Twitter work\n“goes back a decade.”\n\nHe referenced an excerpt from Roque’s deposition where the partner said the\nFTC’s communications made him “fe[el] as if the FTC was trying to influence the\noutcome of the engagement before it even started.”\n\nThe deposition also details two meetings between Roque and FTC officials, where\nhe said the FTC asked Ernst & Young about what the assessor knew about the\nchanges at Twitter amid Musk’s takeover. In a January meeting, Roque told\nlawyers representing Twitter that the FTC gave Ernst & Young a list of areas\nthey wanted the assessor to look at. He described the requests as unusual.\n\n“It was almost as if they were giving us components of our audit program to\nexecute,” he said.\n\nKhan said she was not familiar with the specifics of the deposition. The FTC\ndeclined to comment on Twitter’s filing.\n\nBut letters included in the court filings show the FTC pushing back on Twitter’s\nclaims. A group of FTC attorneys on Tuesday sent a letter to Musk’s lawyers,\ncalling accusations of bias “completely baseless.” In a letter this month, FTC\nattorneys wrote that there is “nothing inappropriate” about the agency’s probe\nand accused Twitter’s lawyers of making a “selective excerpt” from the\ntranscript of the Roque deposition.\n\n“In no way did FTC staff ever attempt to ‘influence’ EY to issue a report\nconcluding there were deficiencies in Twitter’s privacy and information security\nprogram,” FTC attorneys Reenah L. Kim, Anne Collesano and Erik Jones wrote in a\nJuly letter to Twitter’s lawyers.\n\nErnst & Young declined to comment, citing “active litigation regarding a former\nengagement.”\n\nRep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.) noted the timing of the Twitter filing, just hours\nbefore the hearing. She said it was a “pretty lucky coincidence” that the\nevidence supporting the Republicans’ accusations was released in “such a timely\nmanner.”\n\nThe FTC’s investigation of Twitter predated Musk’s ownership of the company.\nLast year, the agency began probing a complaint from whistleblower Peiter\n“Mudge” Zatko alleging that the company buried “egregious deficiencies”\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2022/twitter-whistleblower-sec-spam/?itid=lk_inline_manual_36]\nin violation of an order that the company reached with the FTC.\n\nFollowing a 2011 settlement, Twitter agreed to implement, monitor and adjust\nsecurity safeguards to protect users. But in 2022, the Justice Department\naccused the company of asking users for their phone numbers in the name of\nincreased security, then using the numbers for marketing. Twitter agreed to pay\na $150 million fine\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/25/twitter-fine-ftc/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template&itid=lk_inline_manual_38]\nfor allegedly breaking the 2011 order, which barred the company from making\nmisrepresentations about the security of personal data.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (N.Y), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee,\ncriticized Republicans, saying they were wasting taxpayer dollars to protect a\ntech executive who shares their political views. He defended Khan against\naccusations that the Twitter probe was politicized.\n\n“Twitter has been in trouble for failing to adequately protect the privacy of\nits users for more than a decade,” Nadler said. “This work has nothing to do\nwith the new owner of the company and his political views. Protecting user\nprivacy is not political.”\n\nWill Oremus contributed to this report."

IRPs are filed at least\nevery five years to create a projection of a utility’s plan for the near future.\n\nNessel’s office called on the company to improve service reliability,\naffordability, and accountability.\n\nThe MPSC is expected to consider the proposed settlement at its next meeting,\nNessel said.\n\nHere are seven highlights of the settlement, according to Nessel’s office:\n\n\nCOAL USE\n\nDTE Energy has agreed to end its use of coal to generate electricity in 2032,\nwhich is almost 10 years earlier than previously planned.\n\nThe Monroe coal plant -- which is the fourth-largest coal-fired power plant in\nthe United States -- will be closed at that time. That plant is considered the\nthird-largest polluter in the country, based on carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nClosing the plant earlier will result in 21.2 fewer tons of carbon being\nreleased into the air, according to Nessel.\n\n\nAFFORDABILITY\n\nCustomers will save more than $100 million by securitizing at a lower rate over\n$1 billion in early retired coal plant assets and reducing the return on equity\non the current coal plants.\n\n\nLOW-INCOME CUSTOMERS\n\nDTE Energy has agreed to donate $38 million to help make services affordable for\nlow-income customers.\n\nOf that total, $8 million will go toward energy efficiency and renewable\nprojects for those customers, and $30 million will go toward reducing the amount\nof money that’s currently owed by those customers.\n\n\nTRANSPARENCY IN POLITICAL DONATIONS\n\nThe company has agreed to “provide transparency to its political donations,”\nNessel’s release said.\n\nDTE will disclose all donations of at least $5,000 publicly each October. That\nincludes donations made by the parent company and regulated utilities.\n\n\nAPPLY FOR FUNDING\n\nNessel said DTE has committed to apply for any state and federal funding that\nbecomes available and would help retire coal plants. The net savings would be\npassed along to customers.\n\n\nSELF-OWNED RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nDTE agreed to increase the distributed generation cap from 1% to 6%, which will\ngive more customers the option to own their renewable energy, Nessel said.\n\n\nLOW-INCOME ENERGY WASTE REDUCTION\n\nDTE agreed to allocate at least $43.8 million to income-qualified electric\nenergy waste reduction programs in 2024 and another $53.8 million in 2025.\n\nThis part of the settlement is designed to help customers lower their monthly\nelectric bills and reduce carbon emissions.\n\nHere is a statement from DTE Energy chairman and CEO Jerry Norcia:\n\n> Our CleanVision Integrated Resource Plan will end our use of coal in 2032\n> while developing enough Michigan-made renewables to power approximately 4\n> million homes. Today’s historic agreement is an investment in Michigan’s\n> future, and we are grateful that 21 organizations from across Michigan have\n> joined us in bringing our proposal one step closer to reality. This\n> partnership and dedication have helped us build the best plan possible for our\n> customers. We are also proud this plan puts our customers first by reducing\n> the future costs of our clean energy transformation by $2.5 billion, while\n> reliably generating cleaner, affordable energy now, and for generations to\n> come.\n> \n> This plan will make Michigan a national leader in renewable energy by\n> accelerating the Company’s move to carbon-free energy. We are proud to be\n> Michigan’s largest producer and investor in renewable energy. Through our\n> CleanVision Plan, we will invest $11 billion over the next 10 years – helping\n> to retain and grow businesses in Michigan while ensuring the state meets its\n> sustainability goals. This plan also continues our commitment to our\n> employees, customers and communities, and we will direct an additional $110\n> million to support our most vulnerable customers. We appreciate the\n> contributions of all stakeholders as we wait for the MPSC’s decision on the\n> plan.\n> \n> DTE Energy chairman and CEO Jerry Norcia\n\nCopyright 2023 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\n\nDERICK HUTCHINSON\n[https://www.clickondetroit.com/team/G4SASQ23SNHMLLGW6RYJORJ2AE]\n\nDerick is the Lead Digital Editor for ClickOnDetroit and has been with Local 4\nNews since April 2013.

CVS administered the vaccine clinic. (Lea Suzuki/San Francisco\nChronicle via AP)\n[https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230712185157-covid-vaccine-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill]\n\nCNN  — \n\nUS health officials are moving forward with plans to sunset the federal\ngovernment’s Covid-19 vaccine distribution program next month and move the\nvaccines to the commercial market this fall, and they are laying out their\nexpectations to manufacturers about what that transition should look like.\n\nOn Thursday morning, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier\nBecerra sent a letter to the CEOs of Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax detailing how,\nafter the transition to commercialization, HHS expects “that vaccines will\nremain available in the types of locations where the public currently receives\nthem – including pharmacies, clinics, healthcare provider offices, health\ndepartments, and other points of care – to maximize access.”\n\nThose three companies, which manufacture the only Covid-19 vaccines currently\navailable in the US, are advised that they should plan for this fall’s vaccine\nsupply and regulatory submissions in enough time for the US Food and Drug\nAdministration to take action and the US Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention to make recommendations on the vaccinations “by the latter part of\nSeptember,” Becerra wrote in a draft of the letter obtained by CNN.\n\nHe added that HHS expects manufacturers planning to offer the vaccines this\nfall, which will be updated from the currently available bivalent boosters, are\npreparing an ample supply of doses for the 2023-24 Covid-19 vaccination\ncampaign.\n\n“Further, we expect that vaccine manufacturers will remain ready to support\npotential surges in demand and evolving circumstances of COVID-19,” Becerra\nwrote.\n\n“Updated COVID-19 vaccines entering the market this fall should be priced at a\nreasonable rate, reflective of the value that you have obtained through U.S.\ngovernment investment. Price gouging behavior takes advantage of the trust the\nAmerican people have placed in you through the COVID-19 response,” he wrote.\n\nThe US government’s distribution of Covid-19 vaccines will begin phasing out on\nAugust 3 in preparation for a September transition.\n\n“In the coming weeks and months, we anticipate that you will work with the\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and other payors to ensure that\nthey have the required information to make payments for the updated vaccines\nthis fall,” Becerra wrote. “As ordering and distribution transitions to more\ntraditional pathways, HHS asks you to find sustainable ways to enable continued\nvisibility of the provider network and availability of vaccines.”\n\nThe CDC detailed in a transition guide\n[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/HHS-Commercialization-Transition-Guide-508.pdf]\nlast week that it will provide access to Covid-19 vaccines for people who do not\nhave health insurance coverage after the vaccines become commercially available.\n\nChildren who are uninsured will be eligible to receive Covid-19 vaccines at no\ncost through the CDC’s Vaccines for Children program\n[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html], which has been around\nsince 1994.\n\nAdults who are uninsured will be able to receive free vaccines through a new\ntemporary program called the Bridge Access Program for Covid-19 Vaccines and\nTreatments.\n\nThe US Bridge Access Program will allow the CDC to purchase and distribute\nCovid-19 vaccines and allocate them through its network of state and local\nhealth departments, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the\nNational Association of County and City Health Officials. Another component of\nthe program involves enabling pharmacy chains to continue offering free Covid-19\nvaccinations to the uninsured through their network or retail locations.\n\n“The bridge program is temporary, beginning in the fall of 2023,” Freeman said,\nadding that the program can help ensure that everyone may have access to the\nupdated vaccine this fall.\n\nIn his letter to the vaccine manufacturers, Becerra wrote that HHS and\nmanufacturers “have been in numerous conversations” and that HHS will continue\nto provide vaccine manufacturers with details to facilitate their partnership on\nthe program.\n\nWhile about 69.5% of the total US population has completed a primary series of\nCovid-19 vaccine, only around 17% has received a dose of the updated booster\nshot that was released last fall, according to data from the CDC\n[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-states-jurisdictions].\n\nIn June, the FDA recommended that Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers make\nsingle-strain booster shots for this fall and winter that would target the\ncurrently circulating Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5. Those updated vaccines are\nexpected to be made available in mid- to late September, should the FDA\nauthorize them and the CDC recommend them. They will be the first Covid-19\nvaccines made available directly from the manufacturers as part of the\ncommercial market, rather than through the US government.\n\nPfizer, Moderna and Novavax have been working on updated versions of the\nvaccines, even manufacturing them in advance. Moderna and Pfizer, along with its\npartner BioNTech, make mRNA Covid-19 vaccines while Novavax makes a\nprotein-based Covid-19 vaccine, an older technology that typically takes longer\nto manufacture at a larger scale.\n\nPfizer has estimated that it would be the dominant provider of vaccines this\nyear, with a projected 64% market share of its first-quarter earnings report in\nMay. It expects about a quarter of the US population to get vaccinated this year\nagainst the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\n\nCNN’s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report."

And they are\nadding to the set of the challenges that this business is already facing that\nis, quite frankly, very disruptive.”\n\nIt is expected that SAG-AFTRA, the actors union, will go on strike Thursday\nmorning\n[https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/sag-aftra-talks-break-down-1235658176/] after\ncontract talks concluded late Wednesday night without a resolution. This will\neffectively halt all scripted film and TV production, much of which had already\nbeen delayed due to the ongoing writers strike, which is in its third month.\nSAG-AFTRA has not gone on strike in over four decades, and the last time both\nunions were striking concurrently was in 1960.\n\nIger said that while he respects the right of the unions to “get as much as they\npossibly can in compensation for their people,” they must “be realistic about\nthe business environment, and what this business can deliver.”\n\nIger continued, “It will have a very, very damaging affect on the whole\nbusiness, and unfortunately, there’s huge collateral damage in the industry to\npeople who are supportive services, and I could go on and on. It will affect the\neconomy of different regions, even, because of the sheer size of the business.\nIt’s a shame, it is really a shame.”\n\nIger’s comments come the day after it was announced that he will remain the CEO\nof Walt Disney Co.\n[https://variety.com/2023/film/news/bob-iger-disney-ceo-extension-2026-1235668668/]\nthrough 2026, instead of stepping down at the end of next year as originally\nplanned.\n\nIn a shocking move, Iger returned as Disney CEO in November 2022, less than a\nyear after his initial exit from a 15-year run at the helm. He took over for Bob\nChapek, with his intention being to look for a new successor. However, with\nDisney’s numerous internal issues and the need to reinvent its linear TV model\nin the streaming age, it was expected within the industry that Iger’s contract\nwould be extended.\n\nIn 2022, Iger’s total pay package was $15 million, though Chapek (who was paid\n$24.5 million) was at the helm for the majority of last year. After Iger took\nover again, it was revealed that he has the potential to earn up to $27 million\n[https://variety.com/2022/film/finance/bob-iger-compensation-package-salary-bob-chapek-fired-1235439151/]\nin 2023, his first full year as returned CEO.\n\nSpeaking of Disney’s linear business, which includes broadcaster ABC as well as\ncablers Disney Channel and FX, among others, Iger said that it “may not be core\nto Disney.” When Faber suggested the idea of a sale, Iger said the company will\nbe “open-minded and objective about the future of those businesses.”\n\n“There clearly is content that they create that is core to Disney, but the\ndistribution model, the business model that forms the underpinning of that\nbusiness — and that is delivering great profits over the years — is definitely\nbroken, and we have to call it like it is,” Iger said. “When I came back, one of\nthe things I discovered was that the disruptive forces that have been preying on\nthat business for a while are greater than I thought. It’s eye-opening. There’s\na reality to it that we have to come to grips with, and we have to come to grips\nwith it now.”\n\nIger also addressed presidential hopeful and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ attacks\non Disney over the company’s opposition to Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill. “The\nnotion that Disney is in any way sexualizing our children quite frankly is\npreposterous and inaccurate,” Iger said.\n\nIn April 2022, DeSantis signed a bill eliminating Disney’s special independent\ndistrict status in Walt Disney World. A few days later, Disney sued DeSantis for\nretaliating against the company’s freedom of speech.\n\nFaber also asked Iger about the Neo-Nazi demonstration that occurred outside of\nWalt Disney World in June. “It was horrifying, quite frankly, and it’s\nconcerning to me that anyone would encourage a level of intolerance or even hate\nthat frankly could even become dangerous action,” Iger said."

Exxon's\nall-stock offer valued Denbury at a 1.9% premium to its Wednesday closing stock\nprice.\n\nDenbury CEO Chris Kendall said in a statement that \"significant capital and\nyears of work\" are required to fully develop its CO2 business, making\ndeep-pocketed Exxon \"the ideal partner with extensive resources and\ncapabilities.\"\n\nPlano, Texas-based Denbury is an oil and gas producer that owns and operates a\n1,300 mile CO2 pipeline network in the U.S., including pipelines that span the\nGulf Coast's petrochemical industry heartland, where Exxon has sought to build a\ncarbon hub.\n\nJefferies analyst Sam Burwell estimated Exxon was paying $1.9 billion for\nDenbury's carbon capture infrastructure and $3 billion for its oil production.\n\n\"The modest 2% takeout premium suggests to us that Denbury realized the\ndifficulty in competing with Exxon to win CO2 offtake,\" he wrote in a note.\n\n\nSHARES FALL\n\nExxon shares dropped 1.9% to $104.46 in afternoon trading. Denbury shares\nslipped to $86.62. Its shareholders stand to receive 0.84 of an Exxon share for\neach Denbury share.\n\nDenbury, which gets most of its revenue from enhanced oil recovery, or pumping\nCO2 into wells to force out more oil, exited bankruptcy in September 2020 and\nits stock has jumped nearly fivefold since as carbon sequestration was embraced\nby U.S. companies to cut greenhouse gas emission.\n\nIts pipeline network and sequestration sites will give Exxon a way to quickly\nprovide carbon removal services to carbon reduction customers such as Linde AG\nand CF Industries. Exxon's own offshore storage sites are years away.\n\n\"It's a very logical, very straightforward way for Exxon to build on its\nexisting business strength in carbon management technology,\" said Raymond James\nanalyst Pavel Molchanov, but adding the deal is \"very small for Exxon, relative\nto its size.\"\n\n\nLOW CARBON BUSINESS\n\nCarbon sequestration has been embraced by oil companies including Chevron\n(CVX.N) [https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/CVX.N], Occidental Petroleum\n(OXY.N) [https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/OXY.N] and Talos Energy\n(TALO.N) [https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TALO.N], which aim to\ncapture and store CO2 underground.\n\nExxon two years ago set up its Low Carbon Solutions business with the aim of\ngenerating hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue from cutting its and\ncustomers' emissions. It has said the business, which includes carbon storage,\nhydrogen and biofuels, could outperform its traditional oil and gas\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/decarbonization-business-could-outgrow-oil-exxon-executive-2023-04-04/]\noperations as soon as a decade from now.\n\nLast year, Exxon struck\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/exxon-signs-with-top-ammonia-maker-its-first-client-decarbonization-business-2022-10-12/]\nits first commercial carbon storage deal with top ammonia maker CF Industries.\nIn January, Exxon said it plans to start operations at its large-scale hydrogen\nplant in Texas in 2027 or 2028.

        "content": "Summers are famously humid in New York State, but life in the Maioli household\nhas gotten more comfortable since the couple installed a new heating and cooling\nsystem — one that isn’t well known yet in the U.S.\n\n“My wife is pretty happy because in the summer we can keep it to as cold as we\nlike,” typically 69 or 70 F, said Joe Maioli, in Ontario, New York. In 2021, the\ncouple installed a geothermal or ground source heat pump.\n\nThe units you see that look like box fans outside homes and businesses are the\nmore common air-source heat pumps. They wring energy out of outdoor air for heat\nand soak up excess heat indoors and move it out when they’re cooling. Geothermal\nheat pumps use underground temperatures, instead of outdoor air.\n\nA major push is now underway to get people to consider ground-source heat pumps\nbecause they use far less electricity than other heating and cooling methods.\n“Ground-source heat pumps average about 30 percent less electricity use than\nair-source heat pumps over the course of the heating season,” said Michael\nWaite, senior manager in the buildings program at the American Council for an\nEnergy Efficient Economy.\n\n“Cooling the house for a month is maybe $10 worth of electricity, and this is\nthe most efficient way to do it,” said Maioli. During the coldest winter month,\ntheir highest heating bill was around $70, he said.\n\nTo install ground-source systems, contractors bring in heavy equipment and drill\nto bury a loop of flexible piping several hundred feet deep in your yard. Water\nflowing through the loop takes advantage of the underground temperature, a\npretty stable 55 F.\n\nA drill rig sits outside a home during installation of a geothermal heat pump\nsystem in White Plains, N.Y., Monday, May 8, 2023.

In summer, the water in the loop dumps heat into\nthe ground. In winter, it pulls heat from the earth with amazing efficiency and\nmoves it indoors.\n\n“We really feel like we’re on the right side of a megatrend,” said Tim Litton,\ndirector of marketing communications for WaterFurnace, a geothermal manufacturer\nin Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\nGroundwater empties into a dumpster while workers drill a hole for a geothermal\nheat pump system at a home in White Plains, N.Y., Monday, May 8, 2023.

(AP\nPhoto/Julia Nikhinson)\n\nWith the better known air-source heat pumps, Litton said, outdoor parts can ice\nover in winter. Then the system has to pull heat from indoors to thaw them.\nThere’s also dirt, animals and debris.\n\nWaterFurnace systems can be put in yards as small as 15 by 15 feet, he said. But\nthe drilling rigs can’t get in where homes are really close together.\n\nThere is “a lot of demand for geothermal right now,” Mark Schultz, president of\nEarth River Geothermal in Maryland said, and the interest in reducing carbon\nemissions is a big motivator for customers. “They have electric vehicles in the\ndriveway and solar panels on the roof,” he said of the sites he goes out to bid.\n\nIn the Midwest, Litton sees a broad range of buyers. “We kind of span the entire\npolitical spectrum — whether you’re a progressive environmentalist or a fiscal\nconservative,” he said. “It’s kind of nice in these divisive times to have\nsomething to agree on,” he said.\n\nThe sticker prices for ground-source are higher than traditional systems. But in\na stamp of approval for their efficiency, last year’s Inflation Reduction Act\nhighly incentivizes them, with a 30% tax credit. So a customer purchasing a\n$30,000 system would end up paying $21,000. If someone doesn’t owe enough taxes\nin one year to benefit from that, they can carry it over to the next year. Nor\nis there any dollar limit on the credit, unlike for air-source units, which are\ncapped at a $2,000.\n\nSome states are offering credits on top of that. In South Carolina, residents\nget another 25% credit, meaning a homeowner there could end up with a 55%\ndiscount off the initial cost. Some utilities offer incentives, too. South\nCarolina customers who have Blue Ridge Electric Co-op as their utility can get\nup to $1,600 per ton for the system they install. A 5-ton heat pump installed in\na 2,000 square foot home, for example, would get $8,000 back from the utility.\n\nPeople who live in places with cold winters and hot summers reap the biggest\nsavings. Still, leaders at three companies interviewed cited initial cost as a\nbarrier.\n\nCorey Roberts lives on Long Island, NY, and installed a geothermal system made\nby Dandelion Energy last July. He was renovating and needed a new heater and AC.\nHe was also interested in sustainability. He opted for Dandelion after comparing\nthe costs with a natural gas system.\n\n“I can tell you the house is the coolest it’s ever been and the heating is the\nsteadiest we’ve ever had since we’ve been living here. We are very happy,”\nRoberts said.\n\nA Dandelion Energy employee inserts a drill extension while putting in a\ngeothermal heat pump system at a home in White Plains, N.Y., Monday, May 8,\n2023.

(AP Photo/Julia\nNikhinson)\n\nThe upfront cost was an eye-popping $63,500, far more than the $27,000 natural\ngas option. But after the 30% federal tax credit plus a $5,000 state tax credit\nfor geothermal plus a rebate from his electric company, it was about $32,000.\n\n“Dandelion was only a $5,000 difference to a conventional system. If you think\nabout how long it takes to recover the costs in savings, it’s quite quick,”\nRoberts said.\n\nThe new system has attracted the interest of friends and neighbors.\n\n“We have a lot of people on the street asking us how it works and we say it’s\njust like magic. Water moves around a pipe in the ground and voilà, here we are\nheating and cooling. It’s amazing,” he said.\n\nDandelion, born out of a Google innovation lab in 2017, designs, installs, and\nmaintains its own systems in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. CEO\nMichael Sachse said the inspiration for the company was finding an affordable\nway to control temperature in the home without contributing to climate change.\n\n“There are three main ways that individuals can reduce their carbon emissions:\nchange what you drive, how much you fly, and how you heat and cool your house,”\nsaid Sachse. “Particularly if you’re in a place where the winters are cold, how\nyou heat your home is going to have an enormous impact.”\n\nA drill rig sits outside a home during installation of a geothermal heat pump\nsystem in White Plains, N.Y., Monday, May 8, 2023.

(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)\n\nDandelion is currently working on a partnership with Lennar Corp, one of the\nlargest home builders in the country and thinks in the future, new homes will be\nbuilt with geothermal instead of natural gas. He said Dandelion is currently\nidentifying a community “where we can work on 100 or 200 homes at a time.”\n\nLitton also sees growth for WaterFurnace. Residential geothermal heat pumps\ncurrently make up just 1% of the U.S. heating and cooling market. But they’re\n20% of the European market, due to a long history of higher fossil fuel prices\nand more incentives.\n\nBesides the cost, and the yard disruption, there can be permitting delays,\npartly because some jurisdictions aren’t used to geothermal.\n\nOne further challenge is invisibility.\n\n“You probably drove by several geothermal installations today and don’t even\nknow it because it’s all underground,” said Litton.\n\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from\nseveral private foundations.

        "content": "For Immediate Release: July 13, 2023\n\nEspañol\n[https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/la-fda-aprueba-el-primer-anticonceptivo-oral-diario-sin-receta]\n\nToday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Opill (norgestrel) tablet\nfor nonprescription use to prevent pregnancy— the first daily oral contraceptive\napproved for use in the U.S. without a prescription. Approval of this\nprogestin-only oral contraceptive pill provides an option for consumers to\npurchase oral contraceptive medicine without a prescription at drug stores,\nconvenience stores and grocery stores, as well as online.  \n\nThe timeline for availability and price of this nonprescription product is\ndetermined by the manufacturer. Other approved formulations and dosages of other\noral contraceptives will remain available by prescription only. \n\n“Today’s approval marks the first time a nonprescription daily oral\ncontraceptive will be an available option for millions of people in the United\nStates,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug\nEvaluation and Research. “When used as directed, daily oral contraception is\nsafe and is expected to be more effective than currently available\nnonprescription contraceptive methods in preventing unintended pregnancy.”\n\nNonprescription availability of Opill may reduce barriers to access by allowing\nindividuals to obtain an oral contraceptive without the need to first see a\nhealth care provider. Almost half of the 6.1 million pregnancies in the U.S.\neach year are unintended. Unintended pregnancies have been linked to negative\nmaternal and perinatal outcomes, including reduced likelihood of receiving early\nprenatal care and increased risk of preterm delivery, with associated adverse\nneonatal, developmental and child health outcomes. Availability of\nnonprescription Opill may help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and\ntheir potential negative impacts.\n\nThe contraceptive efficacy of norgestrel was established with the original\napproval for prescription use in 1973. HRA Pharma applied\n[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-application-process-nonprescription-drugs/prescription-nonprescription-rx-otc-switches]\nto switch norgestrel from a prescription to an over-the-counter product. For\napproval of a product for use in the nonprescription setting, the FDA requires\nthat the applicant demonstrate\n[https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2023/017031Orig1s041SumR.pdf]\nthat the product can be used by consumers safely and effectively, relying only\non the nonprescription drug labeling without any assistance from a health care\nprofessional. Studies showed that consumer understanding of information on the\nOpill Drug Facts label was high overall and that a high proportion of consumers\nunderstood the label instructions, supporting their ability to properly use the\ndrug when it is available as an over-the-counter product. When properly used,\nOpill is safe and effective.\n\nOpill should be taken at the same time every day; adherence to daily use at the\nsame time of day is important for the effectiveness of Opill. Using medications\nthat interact with Opill can result in decreased efficacy of Opill or the other\nmedication, or both, potentially resulting in unintended pregnancy. \n\nThe most common side effects of Opill include irregular bleeding, headaches,\ndizziness, nausea, increased appetite, abdominal pain, cramps or bloating. \n\nOpill should not be used by those who have or have ever had breast cancer.\nConsumers who have any other form of cancer should ask a doctor before use.\nOpill also should not be used together with another hormonal birth control\nproduct such as another oral contraceptive tablet, a vaginal ring, a\ncontraceptive patch, a contraceptive implant, a contraceptive injection or an\nIUD (intra-uterine device).\n\nUse of Opill may be associated with changes in vaginal bleeding patterns, such\nas irregular spotting and prolonged bleeding. Consumers should inform a health\ncare provider if they develop repeated vaginal bleeding after sex, or prolonged\nepisodes of bleeding or amenorrhea (absence of menstrual period). Individuals\nwho miss two periods (or have missed a single period and have missed doses of\nOpill) or suspect they may be pregnant should take a pregnancy test. Consumers\nshould discontinue Opill if pregnancy is confirmed. \n\nOpill is not for use as emergency contraception and does not prevent pregnancy\nafter unprotected sex. Oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission\nof HIV, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, genital\nherpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B and syphilis. Condoms should be\nused to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nThe FDA granted the approval to Laboratoire HRA Pharma, recently acquired by\nPerrigo Company plc.\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n\n###\n\nBoilerplate\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nprotects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security\nof human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human\nuse, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and\nsecurity of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products\nthat give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nINQUIRIES\n"

Microsoft has\nsince poured $13 billion into the ChatGPT maker.\n\nIn a blog post\n[https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-risks-of-AI-are-real-but-manageable] on his\nwebsite Gates Notes, the founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation likened\nlarge language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard to other disruptive\ninnovations like cars and nuclear weapons.\n\nBoth had filled the public with fear, Gates pointed out, and yet, through a\nseries of guardrails, had been wrestled into a usable form.\n\n“We didn’t ban cars—we adopted speed limits, safety standards, licensing\nrequirements, drunk-driving laws, and other rules of the road,” wrote Gates—who\njust helped mint another A.I. unicorn\n[https://fortune.com/2023/06/29/bill-gates-ai-unicorn-1-3-billion-funding-eric-schmidt-nvidia-inflection/].\n\n“Although the world’s nuclear nonproliferation regime has its faults, it has\nprevented the all-out nuclear war that my generation was so afraid of when we\nwere growing up.”\n\nUsing nuclear weapons as an example, Gates suggested regulators should look to\nhistory for a blueprint on how to handle the development of chatbots.\n\nHe explained: “For example, it will have a big impact on education, but so did\nhandheld calculators a few decades ago, and, more recently, allowing computers\nin the classroom. We can learn from what’s worked in the past.”\n\nThe result, Gates believes, is that “the future of A.I. is not as grim as some\npeople think or as rosy as others think.”\n\nIt’s this opinion that has previously incurred the wrath of fellow tech titan,\nTesla [https://fortune.com/company/tesla/] CEO Elon Musk. In a response to one\nof Gates’ earlier essays on the power of LLMs, Musk lashed out\n[https://fortune.com/2023/03/28/elon-musk-tesla-twitter-ceo-feud-bill-gates-microsoft-over-ai-chatgpt-openai-talks/]:\n“I remember the early meetings with Gates. His understanding of A.I. was\nlimited. Still is.”\n\nAt the time Musk was one of the early signatories of an open letter calling a\nsix-month pause\n[https://fortune.com/2023/06/17/elon-musk-ai-pause-open-letter-did-not-think-anyone-would-actually-agree/]\non the development of anything more advanced than OpenAI’s GPT-4 chatbot. The\nTwitter [https://fortune.com/company/twitter/] owner has since launched his own\nA.I. company, xAI.\n[https://fortune.com/2023/07/12/elon-musk-launches-ai-startup-xai-history-remarks-critical/]\n\n\nA.I. SHOULD BE TURNED ON ITSELF\n\nGates also believes that the problems created by A.I. can be combated by the\ntechnology itself.\n\nTake deepfakes—created by a type of A.I. called deep learning that can produce\nrealistic videos and images that are digitally altered—which Gates believes have\nthe power to undermine elections and democracy\n[https://fortune.com/2023/05/15/turkeys-deepfake-influenced-election-spells-trouble/]\nas well as have “horrific emotional impact” on individual victims.\n\nGates, reportedly worth $134 billion\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/william-h-gates/], said he is\n“hopeful” however, thanks to the fact that A.I. can not only create deepfakes\nbut also identify them. Intel [https://fortune.com/company/intel/], he\nhighlighted, has developed a deepfake detector while the government’s Defense\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency is working on technology\n[https://www.darpa.mil/program/semantic-forensics] to identify whether video or\naudio has been manipulated.\n\nThe 67-year-old is also “guardedly optimistic”\n[https://fortune.com/2023/03/22/bill-gates-elon-musk-chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-ai-technology-breakthrough-personal-computing-revolution/]\nthat the security industry will be able to combat more advanced hackers by using\nthe technology to their own effect.\n\n“A.I. can be used for good purposes as well as bad ones,” he wrote—pointing out\nthat government and private-sector security teams need to have access to the\nmost up-to-date technology in order to combat such attacks.\n\nGates made a veiled dig at the Musk-backed development pause for this reason,\nwriting: “This is also why we should not try to temporarily keep people from\nimplementing new developments in A.I., as some have proposed.\n\n“Cybercriminals won’t stop making new tools. Nor will people who want to use\nA.I. to design nuclear weapons and bioterror attacks. The effort to stop them\nneeds to continue at the same pace.”\n\n\nGOVERNMENTS NEED TO STEP UP\n\nGates also addressed two of the major concerns from the public: job losses and\nchanges to education.\n\nOn job losses—of which Goldman Sachs\n[https://fortune.com/company/goldman-sachs-group/] has predicted there will be\n300 million\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/03/31/goldman-sachs-predicts-300-million-jobs-will-be-lost-or-degraded-by-artificial-intelligence/]\nbecause of A.I.—Gates squarely placed the responsibility on governments and\nbusiness: “They’ll need to manage it well so that workers aren’t left behind—to\navoid the kind of disruption in people’s lives that has happened during the\ndecline of manufacturing jobs in the United States.”\n\nAcross the board—from deepfakes\n[https://fortune.com/2023/05/11/minnesota-bill-criminalize-political-sexual-deepfake-images/]\nto children using ChatGPT to do their homework\n[https://fortune.com/2023/02/14/chatgpt-school-lessons-cheating-robots-ai-teachers/]—Gates\ntold policymakers they need to “be equipped to have informed, thoughtful\ndialogue with their constituents,” as well as establishing how closely they\nwould work with other countries on legislation.\n\nLastly, Gates had advice for the public: engage.\n\n“It’s the most transformative innovation any of us will see in our lifetimes,\nand a healthy public debate will depend on everyone being knowledgeable about\nthe technology, its benefits, and its risks,” he concluded.\n\nSubscribe to Well Adjusted, our newsletter full of simple strategies to work\nsmarter and live better, from the Fortune Well team.

(Bastian told CNBC he recently traveled to the south of France.)\n\nPremium ticket revenue growth also outpaced that of main cabin economy.\n\nUnit revenues, a measure of how much airlines are generating for every seat they\nfly a mile, rose 1% year over year, and a 17% rise in capacity.\n\n\"If you were to ask any quarter in which we grew capacity by high double digits\nand we held our overall pricing, that would be pretty amazing,\" Bastian said.\n\nOverall, fares dropped nearly 19% in the U.S. last month from a year ago and 8%\nfrom May, as airlines ramped up service for the peak travel season, according to\nthe latest inflation read\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/airfare-is-cooling-as-carriers-add-service-for-summer.html].\n\nBastian said that capacity constraints and strong demand drove fares high last\nyear but that \"we're in a normalized environment today.\" and that Delta's\npricing is still holding up.\n\nDelta's net income for the quarter was $1.83 billion, or $2.84 a share, up from\n$735 million, or $1.15 a share, a year ago. Adjusting for certain items,\nper-share earnings were $2.68, up from $1.44 in the same period last year.\n\nThe airline's net income was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2013, when\nthe airline put more than $8 billion in tax-loss credits back on its balance\nsheet.\n\nDelta brought in $14.61 billion in revenue, adjusted to strip out sales from its\nrefinery, in the three months ended June 30, up 19% from a year ago, and above\nanalysts estimates. Total revenue of $15.58 billion was up 13% from a year\nearlier."

The\nTeamsters Local 89 represents around 10,000 members in Louisville. Teamsters\nGeneral President Sean O'Brien called for practice pickets nationwide after\nclaiming UPS presented an \"appalling economic counterproposal\" to the Teamsters\nduring national negotiations for a new labor contract. June 28, 2023\n\nUPS employs about 25,000 people in Louisville and close to 500,000 nationwide,\nwith roughly 65,000 working as delivery drivers. The Teamsters members represent\nroughly 70% of all U.S. UPS employees.\n\nIn 1997, when roughly 185,000 UPS Teamsters walked out for 15 days, the strike\n\"largely crippled the world's largest package delivery company,\" according to\na New York Times article from August 1997\n[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/19/us/teamsters-and-ups-agree-on-a-5-year-contract-plan-to-end-strike-after-15-days.html]. Any\npossible UPS strike this August could have nearly twice as many union members\npicketing than the strike 26 years ago.\n\nToday, with the popularity of online shopping, the world is even more dependent\non UPS, with the package delivery company getting more than 11% of consolidated\nrevenue from its customer Amazon\n[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001090727/000109072723000006/ups-20221231.htm]\nalone.\n\n\"If a strike does occur, I can say that it would be fairly impossible for\nmanagement to keep more than maybe a slight portion running, maybe not even\nthat,\" Morris told the Courier Journal.  \n\n\nWHAT IS UPS DOING TO PREPARE WORKERS?\n\nJim Mayer, a spokesperson for UPS said recently the company has started to share\ninformation with management employees, who would not be covered under the\nTeamsters, about \"continuity training.\"\n\n\"Over the coming weeks, many of our U.S. employees will participate in training\nthat would help them safely serve our customers if there is a labor disruption,\"\nMayer said. \"These activities also will not take away from our ongoing efforts\nto finalize a new contract that ... allows UPS to remain competitive and\nprovides certainty for our customers and the U.S. economy.\"\n\nWhile UPS is taking steps to prepare employees for a change in workload, the\ncompany said it remains focused on avoiding a strike and reaching an agreement\nwith Teamsters before Aug. 1.\n\n\nCOULD NON-UNION UPS WORKERS BE FORCED TO WORK OVERTIME?\n\nUPS union members hold a practice strike outside Worldport, the largest sorting\nand logistics facility in America Wednesday morning in Louisville, Ky. The\nTeamsters Local 89 represents around 10,000 members in Louisville. Teamsters\nGeneral President Sean O'Brien called for practice pickets nationwide after\nclaiming UPS presented an \"appalling economic counterproposal\" to the Teamsters\nduring national negotiations for a new labor contract. June 28, 2023\n\n\"Yes,\" Levinson, with UofL, said. \"To the extent UPS attempts to carry on any\nbusiness, management and other non-union employees may be expected to cross the\npicket line and work overtime and/or duties they don’t traditionally perform.\"\n\nHowever, if a non-union worker refuses to cross the picket line, they cannot be\ndisciplined\n[https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/employees/right-to-strike-and-picket]\nunless they are a supervisor\n[https://umaine.edu/ble/wp-content/uploads/sites/181/2014/11/Picket_line.pdf],\nsaid Paul Clark a professor of labor and employment relations and criminology at\nPenn State University [https://ler.la.psu.edu/].\n\n\"UPS will expect [non-union employees] to cross the picket line.  And they will\nexpect supervisors to come to work,\" Clark said. \"If UPS does decide to make\ndeliveries, they would likely use their non-union workers and their supervisors\nto do as many deliveries as they can.\"\n\n\nDOES A STRIKE BENEFIT NON-UNION UPS WORKERS?\n\nWearing a union t-shirt with the logo \"Will Strike If Provoked,\" Stephen\nPiercey, the communications director for Teamsters Local 89, helped lead a\npractice strike outside Worldport, the largest sorting and logistics facility in\nAmerica Wednesday morning in Louisville, Ky. The Teamsters Local 89 represents\naround 10,000 members in Louisville. June 28, 2023\n\n\"I think the long-term impact will be favorable,\" Levinson said. \"Non-union\nemployees are likely to ultimately make economic gains similar to their\nunionized co-workers and to benefit from the non-economic gains the unionized\ncoworkers win.\"\n\nIn 2021, John Deere non-union workers saw 8% wage increases\n[https://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/business/2021/11/23/john-deere-strike-ends-non-union-workers-wages-raised/8741602002/]\nfollowing a five-week strike by the United Auto Workers, UAW union. According to\nthe U.S. Department of Labor\n[https://www.dol.gov/general/workcenter/union-advantage], this occurrence with\nDeere & Co.'s non-union workers is not an outlier.\n\n\"Labor unions improve wages and working conditions for all workers, whether they\nare union members or not,\" the U.S. Department of Labor website\n[https://www.dol.gov/general/workcenter/union-advantage] stated.\n\nA report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf] indicates that non-union\nworkers \"had median weekly earnings that were 85% of earnings\" made by union\nmembers. Aside from the long-term economic benefits\n[https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/f46bc621-abb1-4cb9-9523-27029254e47b/union-issue-brief-final-final.pdf]\nnon-union UPS employees are likely to receive, they also stand to benefit from\nsome of the non-economic benefits such as a tentative agreement to install air\nconditioning in vehicles\n[https://twitter.com/Teamsters/status/1668760152416325632].\n\n\nWILL UPS HIRE STRIKE REPLACEMENT WORKERS?\n\nDuring a strike, UPS could choose to hire strike replacement workers, but Clark\nspeculates this may be challenging in the current economic climate \"because of\nlow unemployment at the moment.\" If UPS were to hire permanent replacements, the\nstrikers would be placed on a preferential hiring list\n[https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/employees/right-to-strike-and-picket]\nif their employment was not immediately reinstated following the conclusion of\nthe strike.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME STRIKE IMPACTS FOR NON-UNION UPS WORKERS?\n\nUPS worker Chris Wallace, right, waves at drivers as he and members of Teamsters\nLocal 89 began a practice strike outside Worldport, the largest sorting and\nlogistics facility in America Wednesday morning in Louisville, Ky. The\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters says UPS presented \"an appalling economic\ncounterproposal\" during national negotiations for a new labor contract. June 28,\n2023\n\nNon-union workers are likely to see additional workload expectations in the\nevent of a strike. Management, supervisors and other clerical staff that may not\nbe covered by the Teamsters contract \"could be told to keep the packages moving\"\nwhile the union members walk the picket lines, Morris said.\n\nClark said UPS could try and lean on the non-union workers to keep the company\nafloat during a strike.\n\nTypically, non-union workers are employed at will, meaning the company does not\nhave to provide work. If UPS were to shut down some or part of its operations\nduring a strike, the non-union workers \"must exhaust vacation or personal days\nor take unpaid leave, unless their individual contract provides otherwise,\"\nLevinson said.\n\nIn the event a UPS shutdown was to occur during a strike, Levinson said\nnon-union workers are likely to lose wages and unlike Teamsters, there is no\nstrike fund to financially support non-union employees.\n\n\"The reality is that only UPS knows for certain what impacts will be felt by the\nnon-union workforce at UPS as they will decide what work their non-union\nworkforce will do during a strike,\" Morris said.\n\nTyler Jett contributed to this report.

        "content": "A new Biden administration rule aimed at reducing carbon emissions would give\napproval authority over large U.S. defense contracts to a little-known British\nenvironmentalist group that just incorporated two weeks ago.\n\nUnder the White House’s proposed rule change, a London-based group called the\nScience Based Targets Initiative that is funded by the Democratic Party’s main\ndark money network would be responsible for approving the carbon emissions\nreduction plans of large federal contractors.\n\nThe Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) is a fee-based service that helps\ncompanies set emissions reduction targets in line with the Paris Climate\nAgreement and verifies their progress. But its foreign status and murky\nfinancial background raise questions about the Biden administration’s decision\nto outsource its vetting process to the group. Critics say the proposal would\ngive SBTi enormous veto power over American defense contracts and access to\npotentially sensitive data about U.S. military suppliers.\n\n\"I think Americans will be upset when they realize the Biden administration is\ntrying to put a bunch of unelected bureaucrats and a climate activist\ngroup—headquartered in London—in charge of long-term planning for our national\ndefense contractors,\" said Travis Fisher, a senior energy research fellow at the\nHeritage Foundation.\n\nThe rule change is expected to impact 671 large contractors across multiple\nfederal agencies, and steer an estimated $1.2 million in mandatory fees to SBTi\neach year, according to the proposal\n[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/14/2022-24569/federal-acquisition-regulation-disclosure-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-climate-related-financial#h-21],\nwhich is still awaiting approval from government administrators.\n\nAlthough SBTi publicly launched in 2015, the organization didn’t officially\nexist until June 26, when it filed incorporation papers in London, according to\nUnited Kingdom business records reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. The\ngroup is not registered in the United States. SBTi didn't respond to a request\nfor comment.\n\nBefore its incorporation, SBTi was a partnership co-managed by five activist\ngroups, including the \"We Mean Business Coalition,\" a front group for a $900\nmillion left-leaning dark money organization called the New Venture Fund. The\noff-the-books arrangement allowed SBTi to operate without filing financial\ndisclosures for nearly a decade.\n\nIn 2015, the New Venture Fund, which promotes Democratic policies through an\narray of unincorporated shell organizations, helped launch and fund SBTi through\nthe We Mean Business Coalition.\n\n\"Since its inception, [the We Mean Business Coalition] has been funding SBTi and\nmobilizing business towards science-based targets. One of our earliest\nmilestones was reaching 150 corporate commitments to SBTi in 2016,\" said the We\nMean Business website, where it also described itself as a \"project of the New\nVenture Fund.\"\n\nSBTi's connection to the New Venture Fund could raise questions about its\npolitical leanings. The New Venture Fund is facing scrutiny over its charity\nstatus, after the Free Beacon reported\n[https://freebeacon.com/democrats/top-democratic-operatives-were-quietly-pulling-the-strings-at-a-voting-rights-group-lawyers-say-they-may-have-broken-the-law/]\nthis week on a trove of internal documents and whistleblower allegations that\nindicate the group engaged in prohibited political activities during the 2020\nelections. The documents also show that the liberal network maintains a high\nlevel of involvement in groups that it funds.\n\nSBTi has also faced criticism from former allies over potential conflicts of\ninterest and lack of transparency. Bill Baue, a sustainability expert who served\non SBTi’s technical advisory board until 2020, described its operations as \"ad\nhoc and haphazard\" and compared the group’s leadership to the \"Keystone Cops.\"\n\nBaue said the organization doesn’t appear to have any procedures in place to\naddress financial conflicts, ethics issues, or proper governance. When he voiced\nthese issues internally, and later, in a formal complaint, he said leadership\nbrushed him off and refused to respond.\n\nSBTi would be \"operating in a quasi-regulatory stance\" under the Biden\nadministration’s proposed rule change, Baue told the Free Beacon. \"And yet it\ndoesn’t have the kind of checks and balances or transparency for such an\norganization…certainly there’s reason to be concerned.\"\n\nThese issues could add to objections already raised by lawmakers and U.S.\nbusinesses. The American Bankers Association submitted\n[https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/federal-climate-disclosure-letter]\na public comment criticizing the rule change in February, saying it \"hands\npractical regulatory powers to non-governmental organizations\" without verifying\nthe \"suitability of these organizations\" to carry out the work. BP questioned\nthe legality of the rule, saying\n[https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/country-sites/en_us/united-states/home/documents/who-we-are/us-advocacy/2023/bp-america-inc-comments-on-the-federal-acquisition-regulatory-council-FAR-Council-proposed-rule-on-disclosure-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-climate-related-financial-risk.pdf]\nit \"effectively appoint[s] a third-party arbiter to determine which companies\nare eligible to be major contractors.\"\n\nHouse Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Frank Lucas (R., Okla.),\nwho sent a letter\n[https://republicans-science.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/5010748d-ea2a-435c-b63f-2603c9d15418/AFBCC3D9063875ADC02C39DF847F1675.2023-03-10-letter-to-far-on-proposed-emissions-rule.pdf]\nto the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council in March warning that the proposal\ncould have \"detrimental consequences for our national security and mission\nreadiness,\" is looking into holding hearings on the matter, sources told the\nFree Beacon.\n\nThe idea for SBTi first took shape in 2013 during a meeting between climate\nactivists and researchers at the Washington, D.C.-based offices of the World\nResources Institute, a well-established environmental nonprofit funded by many\nof the left’s top benefactors, including the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and\nGeorge Soros’s Open Society Institute.\n\nSBTi didn’t register as a stand-alone entity for eight years after its launch.\nInstead, it was staffed and co-managed by five activist groups: the New Venture\nFund’s We Mean Business Coalition, the World Resources Institute, the Carbon\nDisclosure Project, the World Wildlife Fund, and the UN Global Compact.\n\nBecause of this arrangement, SBTi was not required to file public financial\nrecords disclosing its income, spending, salaries, and other information. The We\nMean Business Coalition was also able to avoid filing such disclosures until\n2021, when it spun off from the New Venture Fund and registered as a stand-alone\nnonprofit group.\n\nParker Thayer, a researcher at the Capital Research Center watchdog group, said\nthis lack of transparency is common for projects associated with the New Venture\nFund.\n\n\"The New Venture Fund is a dark money titan from the left that specializes in\ncreating the appearance of broad public support\" through unregistered front\ngroups, said Thayer. \"[They] allow the left to create the image that numerous\norganizations support their cause when in reality it’s all a one-man puppet\nshow.\"\n\nSBTi has also faced internal complaints. Baue said he was dropped from the\ntechnology advisory committee without explanation in 2020 after he expressed\nconcerns that SBTi was using a weak methodology for setting emissions reduction\ntargets. That method was created by one of SBTi’s parent groups, the World\nWildlife Fund, which Baue said raised questions about \"conflicts of interest and\nself-dealing.\"\n\n\"The effect is that [SBTi] monopolized the marketplace by removing any\ncompetition\" from independent measurement standards, he said.\n\nBaue added that SBTi’s validation service—in which it charges companies a fee to\napprove their emissions reduction targets and plans—also poses a conflict of\ninterest, because it could give the group a financial incentive to weaken its\nstandards in order to attract more paying clients.\n\n\"If you’re the standard-setter and you’re also making money from the validations\nthere’s at least a temptation to water down your standards in order to continue\nto have a flow of validation revenue,\" said Baue."

However, ChatGPT's success\nhas sparked a wave of rival services to pop up, raising concern among global\nregulators about the potential risks around the technology.\n\nChinese technology giants have jumped on the bandwagon, announcing plans and\nlaunching their own generative AI services.\n\nBut China, which tightly controls the domestic internet via censorship and\nregulation, is watching AI development closely. Chinese regulators are concerned\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/14/chinas-tech-giants-plan-chatgpt-clones-and-beijing-is-watching-closely.html]\nabout the potential for these services to generate content which may go against\nBeijing's views or ideology.\n\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT TECH AND CRYPTO FROM CNBC PRO\n\nThat's partly why Chinese tech firms have been circumspect about launching their\nChatGPT-like services. Rather than full services that are widely available to\nthe public, Chinese companies have focused their technology on enterprise and\nnarrow uses.\n\nFor example, Alibaba this month launched an artificial intelligence tool that\ncan generate images from prompts called Tongyi Wanxiang\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/07/alibaba-launches-ai-tool-to-generate-images-from-text-.html],\nbut it is only available for enterprise customers for beta testing.\n\nHowever, the rules from the CAC provide technology giants a framework to work\nwith when it comes to the technology.\n\n\nWHAT ARE CHINA'S GENERATIVE A.I. RULES?\n\nThe rules will only apply to generative AI services that are available to the\ngeneral public rather than those being developed in research institutions, for\nexample.\n\nGenerative AI services will need to obtain a license to operate, the CAC said.\n\nIf a generative AI service provider finds \"illegal\" content, it should take\nmeasures to stop generating that content, improve the algorithm and then report\nthat material to the relevant authority.\n\nProviders of these services must conduct security assessments on their product\nand ensure user information is secure.\n\nGenerative AI services in China must also adhere to the \"core values of\nsocialism,\" the CAC said.\n\nStill, regulators are trying to strike the balance between making China a leader\nin artificial intelligence while keeping a close eye on its development.\n\nThe CAC's rules said the regulation aims to encourage innovative applications of\ngenerative AI and support the development of related infrastructure like\nsemiconductors."

(AP Photo/Alvaro Barrientos) –\n\nAlvaro Barrientos/AP\n\nSpain’s tourism minister, Héctor Gómez, called it “a historic summer for\ntourism,” with 8.2 million tourists arriving in May alone, breaking records for\na second straight month. Still, some hotel groups say reservations slowed in the\nfirst weeks of summer, owing to the steep rise in prices for flights and rooms.\n\nCosts are growing as flights from the U.S. to Europe are up 2% from 2019 levels,\naccording to ForwardKeys.\n\n“The rising appetite for long-haul travel from America is the continued result\nof the ‘revenge travel’ boom caused by the pandemic lockdowns,” said Tim\nHentschel, CEO of HotelPlanner, a booking site. “Big cities within these popular\nEuropean countries are certainly going to be busy during the summer.”\n\nAmericans have pushed arrivals in Italian bucket-list destinations like Rome,\nFlorence, Venice and Capri above pre-pandemic levels, according to Italy’s hotel\nassociation, Federalberghi.\n\nHere’s the latest for Thursday July 13th: New attack on Kyiv, Ukraine; Two\nBirmingham, Alabama firefighters shot; Tornado strikes Chicago area; US heat\nwave not cooling off.\n\nThey bring a lot of pent-up buying power: U.S. tourists in Italy spent 74% more\nin tax-free indulgences in the first three months of the year, compared with\nsame period of 2019.\n\n“Then there is the rest of Italy that lives from Italian and European tourism,\nand at the moment, it is still under 2019 levels,” Federalberghi president\nBernabo Bocca said.\n\nHe expects it will take another year for an across-the-board recovery. An\neconomic slowdown\n[https://apnews.com/article/europe-economy-recession-energy-prices-bcb1b7748789040780a77a9ffab9ee43]\ndiscouraged German arrivals, while Italians “are less prone to spending this\nyear,” he said.\n\nAnd wallets will be stretched.

The canal-lined\ncity counts 49,432 residents in its historic center and 49,272 tourist beds,\nnearly half of those being apartments available for short-term rental.\n\nInconveniences are “daily,” said Giacomo Salerno, a researcher at Venice’s Ca’\nFoscari University focusing on tourism.\n\nIt difficult to walk down streets clogged with visitors or take public water\nbuses “saturated with tourists with their suitcases,” he said.\n\nStudents cannot find affordable housing because owners prefer to cash in with\nvacation rentals. The dwindling number of residents means a dearth of services,\nincluding a lack of family doctors largely due to the high cost of living,\ndriven up by tourist demand.\n\nVenice has delayed plans to charge day-trippers a tax to enter the city, meant\nto curb arrivals. But activists like Salerno say that will do little to resolve\nthe issue of a declining population and encroaching tourists, instead cementing\nVenice’s fate as “an amusement park.”\n\n“It would be like saying the only use for the city is touristic,’’ Salerno said.\n\n\n____\n\nAP reporters Aritz Parra in Rome, Derek Gatopoulos in Athens, Ciaran Gilles in\nMadrid, Angela Charlton in Paris and Kelvin Chan in London contributed."

He said he’s in favor of some\nindustrial policy lately, for the first time in his life, but only as it relates\nto national security and competitiveness.\n\n“There shouldn’t be social policy around that,” he said adding that “it\nshouldn’t be political it should be purely economic.”\n\nAnd the $5 trillion of stimulus the government authorized, including Biden’s\n$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, to counter the economic effects of Covid,\nwas excessive and is “causing inflation,” Dimon said.\n\nAlthough Dimon said he’s worried about a possible second Donald Trump\npresidential term, he said he doesn’t intend to run for office. A cabinet\nposition, he said, could be in the cards “one day.”\n\nBut if Dimon had the opportunity to shape the country’s economic policy he said\nhe’d institute free-enterprise “growth policies.”\n\nThe country hasn’t been expanding as much as it should over the past two decades\nin part because of bad policies with regard to immigration, taxation, healthcare\nand housing, Dimon said.\n\nAt least for now, though, the “big storm clouds”\n[https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/economy/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase-economy/index.html]Dimon\nwarned about last year only “partially hit,” he said. But he isn’t ruling out a\nrecession in the next six months.\n\nAs many companies still struggle to get workers to commute into office, Dimon\nsaid 60% of JPMorgan’s workforce – including all managing directors – are\nworking in person five days a week. But he’d like that share to go even higher.\n\nAround 10% of JPMorgan’s workforce, he said, was working from home even before\nthe pandemic. The other 30% typically work three days in the office.\n\n“I do not believe you can be a leader and not be accessible to your people,” he\nsaid.\n\nWorking from home doesn’t work for interns and people at early stages of their\ncareers, he said, adding that “it doesn’t really work for creativity and\nspontaneity” and “management teams.”\n\n“To the extent it works, I’m okay with it,” Dimon said. “If it doesn’t work, I\ndon’t mind getting rid of it either.”\n\nBut he conceded, “we’re not going to make that decision, because we’re pandering\nto employees.”"

        "content": "LOCAL NEWS [https://www.local10.com/news/local]\n\n\n\nMIAMI BEACH, Fla. – The fallout continues after another major insurance company\nchose to pull out of Florida’s ailing property insurance market.\n\nFarmers Insurance said Tuesday it will no longer service\n[https://www.local10.com/news/florida/2023/07/11/farmers-becomes-latest-company-pulling-out-of-florida-amid-property-insurance-crisis/]\nthe Florida insurance market, affecting thousands of automobile, home and\numbrella insurance policyholders.\n\n“This business decision was necessary to effectively manage risk exposure,” the\ncompany said in a statement.\n\nThose weren’t the issues Florida lawmakers zeroed in on in a series of reforms\nlast year. Democrats unloaded on Republicans for their handling of the crisis.\n\n“What we saw was a $3 billion bailout for the insurance companies,” State Rep.\nFentrice Driskell, D-Tampa, who leads Democrats in the Florida House of\nRepresentatives, said Wednesday.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis championed the reforms, aimed at curtailing lawsuits and\nshortening claim times.\n\n“I can tell you this - in terms of immediate? You will see more people be\nwilling to write policies in Florida because of what we did,” DeSantis said\nafter signing reform legislation into law.\n\n“Farmers didn’t say it was the litigation climate. Farmers said they are leaving\nthe state because of the high risk and cost of reinsurance,” Rep. Hillary\nCassel, D-Dania Beach, said.\n\nAlmost half of your rising insurance premium pays to reinsure the insurers.\nLawmakers did create an assistance program for them, but only a fraction of\ncompanies qualified.\n\nMeanwhile, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, who oversees\ninsurance companies, dissed Farmers as “woke,” promised to investigate and\naccused the company of playing politics.\n\nThe “woke” claim apparently stems from the company’s commitment to\n“Environmental, Social and Governance” and its decision to become a signatory of\nthe United Nations Principles for Sustainable Insurance.\n\n> I’ve always said that when big decisions are made on insurance the\n> policyholder is rarely in the room; unfortunately @WeAreFarmers\n> [https://twitter.com/WeAreFarmers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] proved me right. I’ve\n> asked my team to put their heads together in holding Farmers Insurance\n> accountable. I want additional scrutiny on this company.\n> pic.twitter.com/fDgadXndfx [https://t.co/fDgadXndfx]\n> \n> — Jimmy Patronis (@JimmyPatronis) July 12, 2023\n> [https://twitter.com/JimmyPatronis/status/1678924297434279936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\n\nActually, that game is over. Records show Farmers closed its political committee\ncontributing tens of thousands of dollars that landed in politicians’ campaign\naccounts, including that of Patronis.\n\nFlorida House Speaker Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast, stood by Republicans’ reform\nefforts.\n\n“While our reforms will take time to take effect, we put the right systems in\nplace to strengthen our insurance market and provide Floridians with the access\nto coverage and peace of mind they need for their property,” Renner said in a\nstatement.\n\nAn industry report\n[http://floir.com/docs-sf/default-source/property-and-casualty/stability-unit-reports/july-2023-isu-report.pdf?sfvrsn=8566a813_2]\nout July 1 showed progress. Insurance companies posted positive net income last\nquarter for the first time since 2016, indicating reforms did start to right the\nmarket for companies.\n\nFlorida homeowners still have a Category 5-sized crisis on their hands, however.\n\nThe board of Citizens’ Insurance, the state’s insurer of last resort, met\nWednesday. It forecasts a double-digit rate hike this year and is adding\ncustomers instead of shedding them, as private companies pull out of the state.\n\n“Nobody wants to pay more for insurance,” said Citizens President and CEO Tim\nCerio. “But even if OIR approves our requested rate increase, our policyholders\nwill still be paying on average about 44% below the rest of the private market.”\n\nThat’s not what Citizens policyholder Willie Butts wants to hear.\n\n“I had no other choice in that move,” he said of switching to Citizens.\n\nButts’ coverage increased by $1,000 with Citizens.\n\nThe disabled veteran feels lawmakers aren’t doing enough to fix the problem.\n\n“I do know that this is something that cannot be ignored any longer because it’s\nonly going to get worse,” said Butts.\n\nProperty Insurance Stability Report:\n\nCopyright 2023 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS:\n\nGLENNA MILBERG [https://www.local10.com/team/PKWEMUBRGVEGVHLJXPXKO4IDKY]\n\nGlenna Milberg joined Local 10 News in September 1999 to report on South\nFlorida's top stories and community issues.

        "content": "Longtime California seafood chain the Fish Market\n[https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/fish-market-santa-clara-closes-17330329.php]\nis leaving the Bay Area. The company is closing its original 47-year-old\nrestaurant in Palo Alto, as well as its San Mateo restaurant and South San\nFrancisco fishery, Farallon, according to a letter from President Dwight Colton\nshared on its website [https://www.thefishmarket.com/2023/07/company-update/]. \n\n“The difficult decision to cease operations at these locations is due in part to\nchanging market conditions, and other factors influencing The Fish Market’s\nability to continue to provide the high-quality seafood dining experience we\nbuilt our legacy on,” Colton wrote. \n\nColton also cited imminent real estate development at the Palo Alto\n[https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/gwyneth-paltrow-ethels-fancy-18092110.php]\nand San Mateo restaurants as a reason for the closures. The Palo Alto Fish\nMarket is scheduled to close Sept. 13, and the San Mateo Fish Market is\nscheduled to close Sept. 20. Farallon Fisheries is set to close in September.\n\n“Unfortunately it’s been inevitable these were going to be turned into\nhigh-density housing projects,” Colton told SFGATE. “We thought we’d try to go\nout on our own terms. … We think it’s the most fair to our employees and\nguests.”\n\nThe California chain’s founders opened the first Fish Market — a seafood\nrestaurant,\n[https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/swan-oyster-depot-sf-review-18182977.php]\noyster bar and market — in Palo Alto in 1976. Soon after, they opened locations\nin Santa Clara, San Mateo and San Jose (both the Santa Clara\n[https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/fish-market-santa-clara-closes-17330329.php]\nand San Jose\n[https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/25/south-san-joses-fish-market-restaurant-will-close-permanently/]\nlocations closed in the wake of the pandemic). At its peak, the Fish Market had\na total of nine restaurants — all in California except for one in Phoenix,\nArizona. \n\nNow, only two Fish Markets remain, and they’re both in Southern California: one\nin Del Mar and the other in San Diego. \n\nAs the final two Bay Area restaurants wind down, both locations will feature\n“weekly specials of favorite menu items offered over the years as a tribute” for\nthe month of August, Colton wrote in his letter. There will also be a\ncommemorative menu in September, followed by a public online auction of\nmemorabilia after the closures. \n\nFollowing the announcement, Colton said the Fish Market has seen an outpouring\nof support from customers. \n\n“On our Instagram and Facebook page, it’s been overwhelmingly positive,” he\nsaid. “People are sharing memories, like, ‘I proposed to my wife in your\nrestaurant,’ or, ‘I used to work there.’ There’s also disbelief, like, ‘I can’t\nbelieve it’s closing after all these years.’”\n\nAs the Fish Market prepares to exit the Bay Area, Colton said he is feeling\ngrateful for their 47 years here.\n\n“I really want to express our gratitude to the guests and all the team members,\nthe thousands of people over all these years who have chosen to work with us,”\nhe said. “The Fish Market, like most restaurants, is a building. What makes a\nrestaurant special is the people and the environment we create, and that’s due\nentirely to our staff over the years. They made the Fish Market magic happen.”\n\nThis story was updated at 2:30 p.m., July 12, to include comments from Dwight\nColton."

Now averaging 7.44%, the decline has reversed most of the\n32-basis-point spike the flagship average saw last Thursday, when the average\nleaped to 7.70% and set what was estimated to be a new 20-year high.\n\nThe 15-year average moved down similarly Tuesday, subtracting 12 basis points\nfor a three-day dip of 22 basis points. Now at 6.89%, the 15-year average had\nhit an estimated 15-year peak of 7.11% last week.\n\nMost jumbo averages marched in place for a third day Tuesday, though the jumbo\n5/6 ARM average gave up an eighth of a point. The jumbo 30-year average\nmeanwhile held again at 6.65%, which is estimated to be the highest reading\nsince at least 2009.\n\nRefinancing rates moved somewhat differently Tuesday than new purchase rates.\nThe 30-year refi average plunged a more dramatic 22 basis points, while the\n15-year refi average actually gained a point. Rates on jumbo 30-year refi loans\nheld steady for a third day. Tuesday's gap between 30-year new purchase and refi\nrates was 45 basis points.\n\n\nAfter a historical rate plunge in August 2021, mortgage rates skyrocketed in the\nfirst half of 2022. The 30-year average shot to 6.38% by June 2022, which was\nmore than double the rate of 2.89% seen just 10 months earlier. Then an even\nmore dramatic surge in September and October 2022 outdid the summer peak, with\nthe 30-year average ultimately climbing another 1.2 percentage points and\nrecording a 20-year high.\n\nThe recent May peak in 30-year rates took the average to another high, 7 basis\npoints above the October high-water mark. But last week's surge raised the bar 5\nbasis points higher. However, it's difficult to nail down precisely how far back\nwe'd have to go to find 30-year rates higher than what we've seen this week,\nsince daily rate averages weren't published before 2009.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nThe rates you see here generally won’t compare directly with teaser rates you\nsee advertised online, since those rates are cherry-picked as the most\nattractive. They may involve paying points in advance, or they may be selected\nbased on a hypothetical borrower with an ultra-high credit score or taking a\nsmaller-than-typical loan given the value of the home.\n\nCalculate monthly payments for different loan scenarios with our Mortgage\nCalculator [https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-calculator-5084794].\n\n\nLOWEST MORTGAGE RATES BY STATE\n\nThe lowest mortgage rates available vary depending on the state where\noriginations occur. Mortgage rates can be influenced by state-level variations\nin credit score, average mortgage loan type, and size, in addition to individual\nlenders' varying risk management strategies.\n\n\nWHAT CAUSES MORTGAGE RATES TO RISE OR FALL?\n\nMortgage rates are determined by a complex interaction of macroeconomic and\nindustry factors, such as the level and direction of the bond market, including\n10-year Treasury yields; the Federal Reserve's current monetary policy,\nespecially as it relates to funding government-backed mortgages; and competition\nbetween mortgage lenders and across loan types\n[https://www.investopedia.com/best-mortgage-lenders-5076852]. Because\nfluctuations can be caused by any number of these at once, it's generally\ndifficult to attribute the change to any one factor.\n\nMacroeconomic factors kept the mortgage market relatively low for much of 2021.\nIn particular, the Federal Reserve had been buying billions of dollars of bonds\nin response to the pandemic's economic pressures. This bond-buying policy\n[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060115/how-do-open-market-operations-omos-affect-bond-prices.asp]\nis a major influencer on mortgage rates.\n\nBut starting in November 2021, the Fed began tapering its bond purchases\ndownward, making sizable reductions each month until reaching net-zero in March\n2022.\n\nThe federal funds rate\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp], which is set every\nsix to eight weeks by the Fed's rate and policy committee—the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC)—can also influence mortgage rates. However, it does not\ndirectly drive mortgage rates, and in fact, the fed funds rate and mortgage\nrates can move in opposite directions.\n\nAt its latest meeting, which concluded on June 14, the Fed paused rate hikes,\nkeeping the fed funds rate at the current range of 5.00% to 5.25%. This was the\nfirst meeting in 15 months in which the Fed did not raise interest rates. There\nis a chance that rates could go up one or two more times this year, though, with\nmembers of the FOMC projecting the fed funds rate could increase another 50\nbasis points before the year ends.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThe national averages cited above were calculated based on the lowest rate\noffered by more than 200 of the country's top lenders, assuming a loan-to-value\nratio (LTV) [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp] of 80% and an\napplicant with a FICO credit score in the 700–760 range. The resulting rates are\nrepresentative of what customers should expect to see when receiving actual\nquotes from lenders based on their qualifications, which may vary from\nadvertised teaser rates.\n\nFor our map of the best state rates, the lowest rate currently offered by a\nsurveyed lender in that state is listed, assuming the same parameters of an 80%\nLTV and a credit score between 700–760."

I'm not sure I\nwant to pay for it.\"\n\nPeter Yang, a product lead at Roblox, tweeted\n[https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1660314935208054785] that the model was\ngenerating faster outputs but that the quality was worse. \"Just simple questions\nlike making writing more clear and concise and generating ideas,\" he added. \"The\nwriting quality has gone down in my opinion.\" He asked if anyone else had\nnoticed this.\n\n\"I've found it to be lazier,\" another Twitter user, Frazier MacLeod, replied.\n\nThe user Christi Kennedy wrote on OpenAI's developer forum\n[https://community.openai.com/t/experiencing-decreased-performance-with-chatgpt-4/234269/77]\nthat GPT-4 had started looping outputs of code and other information over and\nover again.\n\n\"It's braindead vs. before,\" she wrote\n[https://community.openai.com/t/experiencing-decreased-performance-with-chatgpt-4/234269/78]\nlast month. \"If you aren't actually pushing it with what it could do previously,\nyou wouldn't notice. Yet if you are really using it fully, you see it is\nobviously much dumber.\"\n\n\nFROM SLOW AND EXPENSIVE, TO FAST AND INACCURATE\n\nThis is quite a change from earlier this year when OpenAI was wowing the world\nwith ChatGPT\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chat-gpt-2023-1],\nand the tech industry awaited the launch of GPT-4 with rapt anticipation.\nChatGPT originally ran on GPT-3\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-gpt-3-language-generation-model-important-breakthrough-2020-7]\nand GPT-3.5 — these are the giant, underlying AI models that power its uncanny\nanswers.\n\nThe larger GPT-4 launched in March and quickly became the go-to model for\ndevelopers and other tech industry insiders. It's broadly considered the most\npowerful AI model available, and it's multimodal, which means it can understand\nimages and text inputs.\n\nAfter the initial rush to try out this new model, some were shocked by their\nbills for using GPT-4. Sharon Zhou, the CEO of Lamini [https://www.lamini.ai/],\na startup that helps developers build custom large language models, said the new\nmodel was slow but very accurate.\n\n\nTHE SHIP OF THESEUS\n\nThat was the situation until a few weeks ago. Then GPT-4 got quicker, but the\nperformance noticeably waned, fueling talk across the AI community that Zhou and\nother experts said suggested that a major change was underway.\n\nThey said OpenAI might be creating several smaller GPT-4 models that would act\nsimilarly to the large model but would be less expensive to run.\n\nZhou said this approach was called a Mixture of Experts, or MOE. The smaller\nexpert models are trained on their own tasks and subject areas, meaning there\ncould be a GPT-4 specializing in biology and one for physics, chemistry, and so\non. When a GPT-4 user asks a question, the new system would know which expert\nmodel to send that query to. The new system might decide to send a query to two\nor more of these expert models just in case and then mash up the results.\n\n\"This idea has been around for a while, and it's a natural next step,\" Zhou\nsaid.\n\nZhou compared this situation to the \"Ship of Theseus,\" a thought experiment\nwhere parts of the vessel were swapped out over time, begging the question, at\nwhat point does it become a whole new ship?\n\n\"OpenAI is taking GPT-4 and turning it into a fleet of smaller ships,\" she said.\n\"From my perspective, it's a new model. Some would say it's the same.\"\n\nInsider asked OpenAI about this on Tuesday. The company, partly owned by\nMicrosoft, did not respond.\n\nThis week, several AI experts posted what they said were details of GPT-4's\narchitecture on Twitter. Yam Peleg, a startup founder, tweeted that OpenAI was\nable to keep costs down by using an MOE model with 16 experts. Semianalysis\nwrote [https://www.semianalysis.com/p/gpt-4-architecture-infrastructure] about\nthe inner workings of GPT-4 this week.\n\nGeorge Hotz, a security hacker, described an \"eight-way mixture model\" for GPT-4\nduring a recent podcast. Soumith Chintala, who cofounded the PyTorch open-source\nAI project at Meta, weighed in on Hotz's comments.\n\n> —Soumith Chintala (@soumithchintala) June 20, 2023\n> [https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1671267150101721090]\n\n\"I would *conjecture* that the speculations are roughly accurate but I don't\nhave confirmation,\" Allen Institute for AI CEO Oren Etzioni wrote in an email to\nInsider after seeing the leaks online this week.\n\nThere are two main technical reasons to use an MOE approach: better-generated\nresponses, and cheaper, faster responses, he said.\n\n\"The 'right' mixture will give you both but often there is a tradeoff between\ncost and quality,\" Etzioni added. \"In this case, it seems anecdotally that\nOpenAI is sacrificing some quality for reduced cost. These models are very hard\nto evaluate (what constitutes a better response? In what cases?) so this isn't\nscientific, it's anecdotal.\"\n\nOpenAI wrote about the MOE approach in 2022 research\n[https://openai.com/research/techniques-for-training-large-neural-networks]\ncoauthored by Greg Brockman, the president of OpenAI who also cofounded the\ncompany.\n\n\"With the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538] approach,\nonly a fraction of the network is used to compute the output for any one input.\nOne example approach is to have many sets of weights and the network can choose\nwhich set to use via a gating mechanism at inference time,\" Brockman and his\ncolleague Lilian Weng wrote. \"This enables many more parameters without\nincreased computation cost. Each set of weights is referred to as 'experts,' in\nthe hope that the network will learn to assign specialized computation and\nskills to each expert.\"\n\nZhou said GPT-4's unnerving performance decline in recent weeks could be related\nto this training and OpenAI rolling out this fleet of smaller expert GPT-4\nmodels.\n\n\"When users test it, we are going to ask so many different questions. It won't\ndo as well, but it's collecting data from us, and it will improve and learn,\"\nZhou said."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted amendments to certain rules\nthat govern money market funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nThe amendments will increase minimum liquidity requirements for money market\nfunds to provide a more substantial liquidity buffer in the event of rapid\nredemptions. The amendments will also remove provisions in the current rule that\npermit a money market fund to suspend redemptions temporarily through a gate and\nallow money market funds to impose liquidity fees if their weekly liquid assets\nfall below a certain threshold. These changes are designed to reduce the risk of\ninvestor runs on money market funds during periods of market stress.\n\nTo address concerns about redemption costs and liquidity, the amendments will\nrequire institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt money market funds to\nimpose liquidity fees when a fund experiences daily net redemptions that exceed\n5 percent of net assets, unless the fund’s liquidity costs are de minimis. In\naddition, the amendments will require any non-government money market fund to\nimpose a discretionary liquidity fee if the board determines that a fee is in\nthe best interest of the fund. These amendments are designed to protect\nremaining shareholders from dilution and to more fairly allocate costs so that\nredeeming shareholders bear the costs of redeeming from the fund when liquidity\nin underlying short-term funding markets is costly.\n\n“Money market funds – nearly $6 trillion in size today – provide millions of\nAmericans with a deposit alternative to traditional bank accounts,” said SEC\nChair Gary Gensler. “Money market funds, though, have a potential structural\nliquidity mismatch. As a result, when markets enter times of stress, some\ninvestors – fearing dilution or illiquidity – may try to escape the bear. This\ncan lead to large amounts of rapid redemptions. Left unchecked, such stress can\nundermine these critical funds. I support this adoption because it will enhance\nthese funds’ resiliency and ability to protect against dilution. Taken together,\nthe rules will make money market funds more resilient, liquid, and transparent,\nincluding in times of stress. That benefits investors.”\n\nSeparately, the amendments will also modify certain reporting forms that are\napplicable to money market funds and large private liquidity funds advisers.\n\nThe rule amendments will become effective 60 days after publication in the\nFederal Register with a tiered transition period for funds to comply with the\namendments. The reporting form amendments will become effective June 11, 2024."

        "content": "Advertisers are eagerly watching how Meta's [https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/]\nnew Threads messaging app develops over the next few months as they look for a\nnew social channel to reach consumers while Twitter continues to struggle.\n\nInstagram Threads debuted last week and has amassed\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/10/twitter-traffic-is-nosediving-as-metas-threads-hits-100-million-users.html]\nmore than 100 million sign-ups, which has caught the attention of numerous\ncompanies, several digital marketing agencies and industry experts told CNBC.\n\nNatasha Blumenkron, vice president of paid social for marketing firm Tinuiti,\nsaid that Threads has become the topic du jour for her company's clients, who\nare trying to figure out how the messaging app fits into their existing social\nmedia strategies.\n\nMany businesses that have stopped advertising on Twitter over brand safety\nconcerns\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/02/elon-musk-twitter-face-brand-safety-concerns-after-executives-depart.html],\nincluding the reported increase in racist and hateful speech on the platform\nunder the ownership of Tesla chief Elon Musk [https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/],\nare excited about the possibility of advertising on Threads once that option\nbecomes available, Blumenkron said.\n\nMeta is currently more focused on building the core Threads product as opposed\nto monetizing the app, Instagram head Adam Mosseri has said in various\ninterviews and a post on Threads. Many popular features that are common to other\nsocial apps, like the ability to use hashtags or read posts in chronological\norder, are not currently available, and Mosseri has said that his team is\nworking to incorporate some of those tools.\n\nBlumenkron explained that many brands are interested in the potential for\nThreads to add more features like chronological feeds and the ability to search\nfor hashtags. These features can be helpful for companies to ensure that their\nposts are being shown to the right audience and helps them understand which\ntrending topics could inform their content.\n\n\"When we think about playing in the paid space, brands really just want to make\nsure that their content is reaching relevant audiences,\" Blumenkron said.\n\"You're paying to play at the end of the day, and you want to make sure you're\nwhere it makes the most sense.\"\n\nRachel Tipograph, CEO of marketing technology firm MikMak, said that her\ncompany's clientele of consumer product firms and retailers are also interested\nin advertising opportunities on Threads, as they consistently try to \"find new\neyeballs,\" particularly as Twitter's brand safety problems have continued to\nincrease.\n\nMikMak was able to deduce that many of the company's clients significantly\npulled back on their Twitter advertising spend based on how much traffic the\nfirm records from the paid advertising campaigns it helps manage for customers,\nshe said.\n\nFor example, MikMak logged a 42% decline in Twitter traffic between April and\nMay, indicating that companies were pausing their paid advertising campaigns.\nWhen Linda Yaccarino\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/twitter-ceo-linda-yaccarino-echoes-musk-in-focus-on-freedom-of-speech-.html],\nformer NBCUniversal global advertising chief, became Twitter CEO in June, MikMak\nrecorded a 21% increase in Twitter traffic, suggesting that for some brands, the\nlongtime advertising executive's arrival at Twitter caused some companies to\nincrease their spending, Tipograph said.\n\nIt's too early to tell whether the debut of Threads will impact Twitter's\nadvertising sales as of now, Tipograph added.\n\nTwitter issued an automated response when contacted for a request for comment.\n\nBesides Threads' increasingly growing user base, Tipograph said that companies\nare interested in Threads because it shares similar back-end administration\ntools to Instagram, meaning that corporate social media managers could have an\neasier time using the platform. Additionally, companies that already have\nInstagram accounts can essentially port their followers over to Threads rather\nthan building an audience from scratch.\n\n\"It's the most instant onboarding experience I've ever experienced in the\nhistory of my career, and my entire career has been in social,\" Tipograph said.\n\nStill, Tipograph believes that in order for Threads to have a major impact on\nonline advertising, it's going to need users who regularly interact with each\nother on the site, which could be quantified by the number of daily active\nusers, an established marketing metric.\n\nFor Tal Jacobson, incoming CEO of digital advertising firm Perion Network, \"the\nnumber of sign-ups doesn't mean a lot.\" Although it was easy for current\nInstagram users to create Threads accounts, he said, it's unclear how active\nthey will be on the service.\n\n\"The number of conversations is really the number you need to look for,\"\nJacobson said, regarding which statistics would be most helpful for advertisers.\n\nSince Threads is so new, it's unclear which kind of audience Threads is\nattracting, Tipograph said. Companies will be watching to see if the messaging\napp attracts a different type of audience than merely existing Instagram users,\nwhich will impact their marketing plans, she added.\n\nInstagram's Mosseri recently said\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/07/threads-doesnt-need-negativity-of-hard-news-politics-meta-exec.html]\nthat Threads will not actively promote discussions around news and politics, and\nthe company believes that catering to topics such as fashion and sports would be\nless divisive. Because of this, some of Twitter's core audience, who use the\nservice to keep up with the rapid-fire nature of news and politics, could be\nless interested in using Threads, if the platform is geared toward lifestyle and\nentertainment.\n\nEven if Threads doesn't capture an audience interested in news and politics, it\ncould still be a good business for Meta, according to Brian Wieser, a media\nconsultant and former technology analyst. The total addressable audience for\nentertainment and lifestyle content may be much larger than the number of people\ninterested in hard news, which could be a \"a better business\" to focus on and\nless of a reputational risk, Wieser said.\n\nWieser believes it's possible for Threads to represent \"a nice, incremental\nmultibillion-dollar business\" for Meta if it's able to keep users glued to the\nservice, and if it doesn't morph into a video app that's indistinguishable from\nothers.\n\nAngelo Carusone, chairman and president of the Media Matters for America\nnonprofit, said that if Instagram chooses to focus on more lifestyle content\nthan hard news, it won't have the same relevancy as Twitter to influence\nnational and global affairs.\n\n\"It might have commercial viability, but it wouldn't have any real relevancy,\"\nCarusone said.\n\nMedia Matters and other groups including Free Press and Accountable Tech urged\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/04/civil-rights-leaders-issue-urgent-call-for-advertisers-to-exit-twitter.html]\nadvertisers to stop spending on Twitter when Musk took over last fall, citing an\nincrease in hate speech and other concerns.  \n\nAlthough Threads may not currently have the same amount of offensive content on\nits service that drives away users and advertisers, Carusone said that it's\npossible that the same bad actors and trolls who have increased their activity\non Twitter could do so on Threads.\n\nCarusone noted that Nick Fuentes, a livestreamer and outspoken antisemite who\nwas banned from Instagram in 2019, recently said that he created a fake\nInstagram and Threads account and urged\n[https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/nick-fuentes-says-he-joined-threads-and-calls-followers-join-it-red-pill-users]\nhis viewers to \"blow up and red pill some people on there.\"\n\nIf Meta isn't prepared to handle users intent on spreading misinformation and\ndivisive content on Threads, the messaging app risks alienating advertisers in\naddition to users, Carusone said, adding that Meta isn't free from the issues\nplaguing Twitter, particularly after Meta's layoffs on its trust and safety\nteams\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/26/tech-companies-are-laying-off-their-ethics-and-safety-teams-.html].\n\n\"My point is that Threads basically magnifies a problem that Instagram has\n[that] Facebook has never solved,\" Carusone said. \"And I think that is a real\nthing.\"\n\nWatch: Threads becomes fastest growing app in history with 100M users\n[https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/07/10/metas-threads-hits-100-million-users.html]"
